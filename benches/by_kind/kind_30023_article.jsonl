Channel peers must support the `option_simple_close` for this new protocol to work. This new feature can be activated with a new config flag: `--protocol.rbf-coop-close`.\n    *   This feature isn't compatible with older LND versions; fee bumping with them uses CPFP. It already works with Eclair v0.12.0 or up, and should work with other implementations as they roll out support for this protocol. The protocol currently does not support Taproot channels and Taproot asset channels.\n*   **Support for archiving channel backups** **in a specific folder for future reference.** It comes with a new config option, `disable-backup-archive` (default: `false`), to control whether previous backups are archived.\n*   [**Support**](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8390) **for** [**experimental endorsement**](https://github.com/lightning/blips/pull/27) **signal relay.** Deployed experimentally to assist ongoing channel jamming research, it has _no impact_ on routing.\n*   **Initial support for** [**quiescence**](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8270)**.** This protocol gadget is required for upcoming Dynamic Commitments and Splicing features.\n*   **Historical Sync**: Fixed [a race condition](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9424) blocking initial sync due to syncer's internal state handling.\n*   **Max Fee Rate** is [now respected](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9491) during cooperative close initiation for both parties, not just the remote party.\n*   Lots of other [**bug fixes**](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/release-notes/release-notes-0.19.0.md#bug-fixes).\n*   **Performance Improvements:**\n    *   Limit outbound [gossip traffic bandwidth](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9607) with --gossip.msg-rate-bytes and --gossip.msg-rate-burst. Set burst to the maximum bytes transmittable without rate limiting, and rate to the ongoing permitted rate.\n\n*   Ability to use ZSTD for log rotation.\n*   [Remove redundant iteration](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9496) over a node's persisted channels when updating the graph cache with a new node or node update.\n\n*   **Functional Enhancements:**\n    *   [Add pagination](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8998) for wallet transactions.\n    *   [Make](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9562) `MaxWaitNumBlocksFundingConf` configurable for faster test timeouts, with a default of 2016 blocks for production.\n    *   Change sweeper to [attempt sweeps](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9627) if the budget is partially covered, preventing delays and high fees.\n    *   [Validate](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9603) MPP parameters before payment to avoid path finding loops and timeouts.\n*   **Functional Updates:**\n    *   Enable [log compression](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9017) with ZSTD using the logging.file.compressor argument.\n    *   [Enhance SCB file](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8183) with more data for last-resort rescue when a peer is unavailable.\n    *   Update channel.backup file at shutdown in LND.\n    *   Introduce [chainio subsystem](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9315) to sync subsystems with the current best block, fixing delays in HTLC sweeping due to block height discrepancies in ChainArbitrator, UtxoSweeper, and TxPublisher. Click [here](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/chainio/README.md) to learn more.\n    *   Sweeper now uses [configured budget values](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9274) for HTLCs with `--sweeper.budget.deadlinehtlcratio` and `--sweeper.budget.deadlinehtlc`.\n    *   Consider blockbeat dispatcher height [when checking](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9501) if lnd is synced to chain.\n    *   Allocate restricted slots for peers via [\\--num-restricted-slots](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9458).\n    *   Added support for bitcoin [testnet4](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9620).\n    *   [Removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9621) x/exp/maps dependency.\n    *   Add [\\--no-disconnect-on-pong-failure option](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9801) (default: false) to manage peer disconnection on pong failure or mismatch.\n*   **RPC Additions and Updates.** Some RPCs that previously returned an empty response now provide a [short status message](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7762) to help command line users confirm successful execution or background initiation.

At Blackstone, he saw oil and gas credit deals give way to ESG-driven renewables with poor returns, while 2020’s money printing highlighted fiat’s flaws. Bitcoin offered a scarce, durable alternative, and stranded natural gas provided the cheapest power to mine it. 360 Energy began by buying unattractive wells and converting gas into low-cost Bitcoin, later evolving into a service model for producers through infrastructure sales and rentals. Adoption is accelerating, especially in regions with strict flaring rules, and Sean believes major oil companies will integrate Bitcoin mining into drill programs within four years.\n\nBest Quotes\n-----------\n\n*   “We were spending all this brain damage, all this effort on structuring creative deals to make 10%, but someone could print money with the push of a button. Once you learn about Bitcoin’s 21 million, it changes everything.”\n*   “If you’re mining Bitcoin, your largest cost is electricity. How do you survive? Same as oil: the lowest-cost producer wins.”\n*   “These equity returns were zero until year 15. Even then, 6–7%. And that’s with tax incentives. Without them, they were negative.”\n*   “We bought unattractive wells cheap, eliminated pipeline costs, and monetized the gas with Bitcoin mining. Suddenly, break-even assets had real upside.”\n*   “In oil and gas, people thought fracking was crazy, until it worked. Bitcoin mining will spread the same way: one operator proves it, and everyone copies.”\n*   “If we could do AI computing in the oilfield, we would. But Bitcoin is the only workload that runs on Starlink, tolerates downtime, and scales in 1-megawatt chunks.”\n*   “The Bitcoin on our balance sheet gets almost zero credit from lenders. They say, ‘You don’t have much cash.’ But it’s the best collateral on earth.”\n*   “In Wyoming, a large producer shut in oil for over a year because they couldn’t flare gas. With our units, they can flow 200 barrels a day again. That’s the power of Bitcoin mining.”\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nSean’s story embodies the convergence of Wall Street, energy finance, and Bitcoin’s disruptive logic. Where Blackstone’s credit models hit diminishing returns amid fiat inflation and ESG fads, Bitcoin mining offered both higher economics and deeper alignment with physical energy systems. By reframing stranded gas as a competitive edge, 360 Energy is pioneering a new bridge between oilfields and digital money. The path forward lies in demonstrating reliability, building financing models, and expanding into flaring-constrained regions. If early momentum continues, Bitcoin mining could graduate from fringe solution to standard oilfield tool, and eventually reshape how drill programs themselves are planned.\n\nTimestamps\n----------\n\n0:00 - Investment Banking and Energy Finance Experience  \n4:30 - Deal Structure and Investment Focus at Blackstone  \n7:27 - COVID Impact and Shift to Renewables  \n9:51 - Bitcoin Discovery and Orange-Pilling Journey  \n13:18 - Connecting Energy Finance to Bitcoin's Value Proposition  \n17:20 - Partnership with Chris and 360 Energy Formation  \n21:29 - Renewable Energy Economics vs Bitcoin Mining  \n25:27 - Natural Gas Strategy and Asset Selection  \n29:14 - Low-Cost Producer Economics  \n32:12 - Asset Acquisition and Valuation Strategy  \n37:59 - Economic Modeling and Capital Requirements  \n42:22 - Volatility Comparison: Natural Gas vs Bitcoin  \n45:29 - Well Decline Curves and Mining Capacity Planning  \n50:28 - Transition to Service Business Model  \n55:54 - Industry Adoption and Bitcoin Perception  \n59:36 - Equipment Financing and Customer Decision Factors  \n1:07:23 - Industry Dynamics and Risk-Taking Culture  \n1:11:49 - Credit Facilities and Banking Relationships  \n1:18:58 - Strategic Focus and Geographic Expansion  \n1:21:48 - Future Industry Integration\n\nTranscript\n----------\n\n(00:05) Sean, welcome to the center of hash. Thank you. It's good to be here. Your former home, Bitcoin Park. I was going to say it's good to be back in the com or Bitcoin park. We miss you guys. We've only been away for a few weeks, but I know there's a a vacuum that we need to fill a void. Yep. How are things going at the new office? Oh, they're great.  \n(00:28) You know, it's uh it's sad to leave this space, but it's good to have our own space. We're growing the team a lot, so it's nice to have conference rooms to take calls and things like that. Signs of success. Yeah. Yeah, we hope so. You know, the team's grown a lot, putting deals out, so blown and going. Well, Chris, your co-founder and partner at 360 Energy, recorded in July.  \n(00:54) Um, and he and I were catching up and I suggested that we should get you on as well. You have a very different background from Chris and wanted to start out just talking about your the history in the oil and gas space on the finance side and how you came to be working on Bitcoin and specifically Bitcoin mining. You were formerly at Blackstone.  \n(01:18) So just talk a little bit about and then investment banking at credit Swiss for that both on the oil and gas side energy energy side I guess but yeah talk a little bit about your history what you were doing and how you ultimately decided to become interested in Bitcoin and then and then work on Bitcoin mining. Yeah definitely.  \n(01:42) So started at Credit Swiss in the oil and gas group in Houston, went to school in Dallas. Um, and that was like we talked about earlier, led ship for finance. You know, being an analyst in investment bank is a lot of grunt work. Um, but you do learn a lot over your two-year period there after what years was that? That was 16 to 18 in Houston.  \n(02:01) I've done my pledge ship in investment banking as well. New York 2006 to 2009 bank. So that was a pretty wild time and I know what it's like. Yeah. Yeah. Um so that was great but the goal is always to get to the buy side. Um so did two years there and then moved to GSO which was the credit arm of Blackstone. It's rebranded to Blackstone Credit now. Um in New York 25 person team across New York and Houston.  \n(02:28) Um and we were investing when I first joined in all oil and gas companies. So investing across the capital stack mostly preferred equity down to or up to senior secured debt. Um and you know day one it was all oil and gas. So, a lot of upstream deals, some mid-stream deals, a little bit of OFS, and it was just if you need capital as a business to, you know, expand your drilling program or buy more equipment, um, we would be a capital provider to help them do that and make return for our LPS. Um, so that was a great  \n(03:03) experience. You know, it's it's a very intense environment for sure. Uh, a lot of very smart people and I learned a ton. You know, I was there for six years overall. um learned a lot in my first three years.  \n(03:20) It's almost like the first two years are almost like investment banking all over again, but with a different skill set. You're just, you know, working very hard. Um long hours as well, but it's your LP's capital you're investing. So, the the standard is a bit higher on you have to be really sure you're right. Um at an investment bank, it's kind of you're being salesy, right? Um so, that was a great experience.  \n(03:47) Um so a question there one just total as an aside what does GSO stand for? Uh the three founders so Goodman uh Smith and Orover and that was a unit within Blackstone. Yeah. So those three guys were DJ credit squeeze guys back in the 90s. They started GSO early 2000s I believe um I think 2004 and then Blackstone bought GSO in 2008.  \n(04:14) So, and then specifically talk about the like in terms of the deals that you would work on, were you typically working on primary equity financings, credit financing all throughout the capital structure and just the nature of the type of deals that you would yeah have experience with. An example, it was mostly credit focused because GSO was a credit shop.  \n(04:36) Um, we would do minority common equity, but we wouldn't do control common equity. If there was anything controlled, that would go to the private equity group. So, Blackstone kind of has many business segments, right? Private equity, real estate, and then GSO was the credit arm.  \n(04:53) So, a typical deal, for example, um, uh, a midstream or sorry, an upstream operator in the Perian needed $100 million to go drill 10 more wells. We would give them a term loan, $100 million term loan, pretty expensive capital. You know, we targeted mid- teens and then we might co-invest 10 million of common equity alongside. And were these typically I mean presumably if they're getting a $100 million term loan, these are wellestablished companies are really often public companies, private mix. It was a mix. I would say most of the deals were private companies. We would  \n(05:24) do some public stuff. The biggest deal I worked on was a $1.6 $6 billion preferred equity investment into a system called Target Badlands. So Target is a massive mid-stream company publicly traded and they wanted to monetize a part of their Bacan assets, their midstream assets there.  \n(05:47) So we bought a 45% interest preferred interest um for 1.6 billion. You know, that's an example of a a deal we would do with some public guys in Bakans, North Dakota owns oil and gas. Yep. Oil and gas North Dakota. Um, so a gathering system means they have the pipes that actually connect to the wells.  \n(06:05) So they're the ones that build out to the pad, connect to the actual wells, and get those hydrocarbons to market, both oil and gas. And so you were there for six years. You mentioned the first two years being very similar to an investment banking first few years, but in terms of expos","sig":"b4a23cbd15afd46c68af6a772a2ee93ac6d01da213abf3fc0f61c3e9794db07de98a6eddf50ba7d611625e73532ef4c2f75d0829f6393e83f67a5a0129fce5c1"}

We don’t have royals in Bitcoin and we routinely slay our heroes, which means that anybody who sticks around for a long time has Lindy-proven integrity. Svanholm is one such character: If you’ve attended the conference circuit in recent years, you’re likely to have encountered Svanholm’s enchanting voice and scruffy beard — cowboy hat included for fashion and good measure. I’ve always had a weak spot for this fellow Scandinavian, whether it be his uncompromising words or impressive output, his funky demeanor or funny personality. In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine, we chatted about publishing books in the modern age, writing, praxeology — the arcane science underpinning Austrian economics — spirituality, nation-states, the cooperative nature of Bitcoin, how Bitcoin wins and why leaning into “the fun” makes for a better path to the brilliant, bright, orange future we both see. Together with his sidekick and co-author Luke de Wolf, Svanholm has incorporated the publishing house Lemiscate Media in Estonia, which allowed them to accept sats and keep bitcoin on the balance sheet — a bitcoin treasury company, the old-fashioned way. It also offered a convenient way around Amazon’s book publishing gatekeeping and meant that all books became print-on-demand. (All of Knut Svanholm’s previous book — including “Everything Divided by 21 Million” and “The Inverse of Clown World” — are available via Lemiscate.) JB: Knut, tell me about your publishing company. Are you trying to copy Saifedean Ammous and make Lemiscate Media be like his The Saif House? Knut: Yeah, I’ve always been a little bit Saifedean-like, or rather: Saif with a pirate hat. But it’s not because I’m copying Saif on purpose, but rather that things have just played out this way… There’s a reason why that happens. The same thing happened with my book “Praxeology: The Invisible Hand That Feeds You” — I re-wrote it this year and turned it into a full course for Plan ₿ that’ll be released this winter. It was all a very Saifedean-like approach, echoing what he did with his “Principles of Economics” textbook. Mine is much less dense: The chapters are shorter and a bit more accessible than in Saif’s book. JB: One question I had for us sitting down was about your book “Praxeology,” your attempt to connect Bitcoiners with Austrian economists. When it came out, I saw almost nobody writing about it (I did!) — what happened? “Everything Divided by 21 Million,” massive success; “Praxeology,” almost nothing. What gives? Knut: Generally speaking, I think people read less and it’s hard to follow up on a hit. Plus, there are a little too many Bitcoin books right now as well; people don’t know what to choose. The more long-term goal here is to assemble all of the books into one, a “collected volumes” type of thing, leatherbound etc. The podcast I run with Luke de Wolf, Bitcoin Infinity Show, is more for hardened Bitcoiners — conviction-deepening rather than orange-pilling… JB: …then why are you clowning about so much on the show? Knut: Haha… it doesn’t matter what you do, the absolute most important thing is that what you deliver is entertaining in some way. That can be because it’s interesting or because it’s passionate — or because it’s fun! And fun can be a shortcut to entertaining: If it’s fun, people stick around. If you keep your humor about, that becomes a tool for making people listen. We think about this when it comes to Satoshi Rockamoto [the pop-up concert events that Svanholm runs together with Mike Jarmuz, Samson Mow, Martti Malmi etc., eds. remark]. It started way back, at an event in Mexico and we all just borrowed some instruments and were all surprised at how good it sounded… Wouldn’t it be a good idea to do this at different conferences?! JB: Yeah, those shows are amazing, and you can really tell that you guys are having fun. Is it all planned and rehearsed, or do you guys just wing it? Knut: No, it’s completely improvised. This time in Helsinki at BTCHel was the first time we rehearsed together — once. I often gotta pinch myself… Am I really in a band with Martii Malmi and Samson Mow?! What everyone who is anyone in Bitcoin have in common is that they’re just themselves, and that just works. Good times at #btchel #rockamoto with @knutsvanholm @lukedewolf @JoeNakamoto @giacomozucco and many others. Thanks to all the event organizers, and to @SwissHodler and @Jake21m for videography! pic.twitter.com/T46CJCeLkb — Martti Malmi (@marttimalmi) August 17, 2025 Knut: I’m trying to live by my words, practice what I preach… and I’ve long had this idea that we are our satoshis. JB: I remember the first time I heard you say that, on stage in Prague 2023 — and you just looked completely out of your mind! Knut: The entire distinction between satoshis and personhood is pretty blurry: All there is to Bitcoin is keeping a secret from someone else… All nodes, all miners, etc., have a person behind them. They’re not “backed by energy,” but by human action (…which, technically, is also backed by energy). At the end of the day, I always say that Bitcoin is an agreement on a fixed set of rules, and the reason we agree on this specific set of rules is that they are costlier to try to break than to just follow. And that’s what allows for resistance, irreplicability and finiteness. JB: There’s a quote in economics and game theory to the effect of “trading is cheaper than raiding,” but still world history is littered with wars. What do you make of that? Knut: Yes, but if the aggressor thinks that he has enough to profit from violence, there’s a risk he will. Where Bitcoin is different is that I can threaten you with a gun — Joakim, give me all of your sats! — but there is no way for me to know how many sats you have. So game-theoretically, it’s better for me to offer you something of value and trade with you… Bitcoin has moved the point at which aggression pays further out, and this aspect of Bitcoin is so underappreciated. But let’s return to this idea that we are all our satoshis. Everybody wants to pump their bags, and we all benefit from number-go-up, which means all companies and everybody in Bitcoin have an incentive to help each other. With Lemiscate and Bitcoin Infinity Show we’re really trying to put that in practice right now, by giving as much as we can because, in the end, it all comes back to us! Why not cooperate? Take Vexl, the peer-to-peer trading platform out of Prague; they’re not paying us a dime to say this, but I still want everyone to be on Vexl — it’s an excellent service. Bitcoin jobs in general is so completely different than fiat jobs; you don’t even need to, or can expect, to be paid anything to begin with. Rather, you must provide value first and then reap rewards later. That’s so powerful, and most people don’t get that: All I want is for you to flourish. JB: The connection to Praxeology is so obvious: We’ve sort of fiat-ized what “work” is. A job is: you’re employed by someone, you do something and you’re paid by the hour… And there are laws around this, it’s your right as a laborer to receive this money. And nobody thinks about how working is about creating value for someone else. Knut: And that doesn’t stop being true just because someone — the state, labor unions — is trying hard to make that not true. Still, an employer won’t hire anybody if it’s too costly. Say you want to hire somebody in Sweden. Then you have to consider that you can’t fire them very easily, you gotta pay payroll taxes, and income taxes etc., if they’re ill, you have to pay for their recovery, and blah-blah-blah. It leads to this entitlement idea, a culture or I deserve all this. Most people don’t understand how Bitcoin is different here: What happens when there is a way to signal value that’s deflationary, absolutely finite, such that all prices — including salaries — fall over time, while purchasing power rises. If you hire someone, and that someone gets the same amount of satoshis every month, their real salary is effectively increasing… You never need to readjust salaries. Micropayments is such a fiat idea… The entire model of velocity of money is a Keynesian idea.. I think subscription models will increase in popularity. On a deflationary standard, a company has every incentive to receive one larger payment early over many smaller payments later, because it will receive fewer and fewer satoshis every time. JB: Uh, ok… Knut: I think people just underestimate what deflation is. That’s the main thesis in “The Inverse of Clown World”: Everything that’s true in fiat, the inverse of that is true in Bitcoin. On a bitcoin standard, we’ll have fewer transactions — not more. It’s a pet theory I have, and it was in a Bitcoin Magazine article (“The Real Scaling Solution for Bitcoin”) a few years ago: With a richer society, you’ll have fewer transactions. Say ten rich people and ten poor people are having dinner. Among the rich people, at the end of the night, someone picks up the tab, so over time there’ll be ten transactions — one per dinner. But for the poor people, who don’t have enough wealth, everyone has to pay for their own meal on every occasion, meaning a hundred transactions. If we focus on quality instead of quantity, which is what happens in a deflationary economy, what happens is fewer transactions but more significant, valuable transactions. “Will give everyone a reason to save rather than overconsume, giving more people access to whatever they want over time because of the falling prices. If you postpone your spending, your bitcoin will buy you more in the future. In other words, fewer transactions. Quality before quantity. The necessity for transactions per second will diminish.” This article really didn’t pull any punches. In a hundred years, you won’t pay for coffee anymore; the barista will give it to you for free, since he has built up this entire chain of trust over generations, which will ensure that you want to give him something of value. JB: Like that quote you referred to on stage here at BTCHel, know-your-customer laws are economically illiterate; trust is the opposite of money. Trading partners only need to use money when they don’t trust someone. The difference is, you use credit money with those you trust, and commodity money with strangers. Knut: Precisely! You only need money in trade when you don’t trust the people you’re trading with. That’s the problem with credit money altogether: It isn’t money. Even if you have debt notes or credit money, it has to be denominated in something — and that something is what constitutes money. My man Dr. @IoniAppelberg killing it at @btchelevent pic.twitter.com/xX7tOUyQNF — Knut Svanholm ∞/21M (@knutsvanholm) August 16, 2025 I learned this in Murray Rothbard’s excellent book “What Has Government Done to Our Money?” There’s no doubt about it: Credit money is not money. Money represents something valuable; even if that’s a debt, it has to be denominated in something — and it’s that thing that is money. When you accept a receipt for something and you don’t receive the thing back, that’s theft. And that’s what banknotes are. JB: You write something to that effect in the beginning of your 2020 book “Independence Reimagined”, about how collective imagination is one of our greatest strengths as humans — but also our worst weakness. Natural law, property rights, money etc, aren’t out there, in nature, right; we don’t discover them, but invent them, no…? Knut: No, all the way down to molecular biology or complex societies like ant hills, I think, where we find examples of what looks like cooperation and herd behavior, but in reality, you’re backstabbing them — the black sheep of the herd, etc. What’s evolutionarily good for the herd isn’t always the same as what’s good for the herd. JB: This is something monetary scholars often talk about, what is it that money does in a society? Large-scale cooperation, overcoming Dunbar’s number etc. It’s these collective delusions that let a billion Catholics cooperate, or 330 million Americans to all believe in their shared stories — not that America is doing extraordinarily well, but that’s beside the point — the belief that we are one unit is what lets us cooperate so we’ll create bigger things. Knut: Organized religion and, after that, nation-states, might be good for your tribe, for convincing people that they go to heaven if you murder members of this other tribe. And to do that, we have to cooperate, so we need to tax citizens this or that much and then demand that you give your life for the herd. That’s rarely good for the individual soldier. And some of these units have created pretty destructive things, too. For some of these topics — like the question of God — I’m perfectly comfortable not knowing certain things, if I know these are questions we can’t answer. If you were to order the great Austrians in order of religiosity, I think we’d get Mises -> Rothbard -> Hoppe. What I’ve changed my mind about is that I nowadays believe democracy to be the most dangerous religion. It’s better that people believe in a fake friend in the sky than an earthly friend who swindles them. Religion is a tool for managed control, the best way to fool 18-year-olds into war — and psychopaths will use it! JB: What’s the connection to economics or praxeology? Knut: Well, economic thought was actually better before the Enlightenment than after. At that time, all economists were also theologians grappling with the basic question, What does God want? Many of them are opposed to the phenomenon of interest, unethical practices and turning people into debt slaves JB: … like Jeff Booth said in his lecture at BTCHel “No They. Only We”… Knut: Precisely, and it’s not until we get Austrian economics that we actually can explain how interest is ethical — That it’s just the price of tomorrow, to quote Booth. And prices and interest rates fall in a free market. JB: Everything we talk about here is so in the weeds, so deep, so spiritual. Praxeology itself is a bit like that, making us wonder what in the world is this thing we call consciousness, choice, economics? Knut: The basic tenet is that science cannot derive an ought from an is — but with praxeology, we can get pretty darn close! Hans-Hermann Hoppe explains it best, but if I were to try, I’d say, “All communications and interaction between humans are the result of some sort of conflict.” We perceive value in communicating rather than attacking, which means all language is for resolving conflict; we have human language so that we can comprehend one another. From there, you’re very close to absolute property rights. And here’s argumentation ethics: If I say every human owns their own bodies, you cannot rebuke that without proving my point. And from there, we can derive so much knowledge from that, if you only accept those axioms. But they are still pretty darn sound axioms. JB: So why isn’t this sexy? Why doesn’t it sell? I think this is, big-brain gigachad boom stuff… but nobody cares. Knut: …and it’s so goddamn simple that it’s better to cooperate than to use violence. People don’t understand how much they’re being robbed today; everybody underestimates their own value. It’s tragic, but not that hard to explain: You have an institution — public school — entirely funded by theft. You learn math and English and whatever, but you also learn social science, which is nothing but opinions and bullshit. We’re taught obedience rather than providing value. Everything that at some level is supported by government money is corrupt and unethical. These ideas have existed for centuries, but it’s so hard for normies to get past this: If there’s one thing public education shoves down our throats more than anything else, it’s that democracy is the most important and most beautiful thing we have. It’s not. It’s a system that says, because of a popularity contest, you have the right to take others’ stuff; it’s completely wrong, beginning to end. JB: How do you see this fixed? How do we win? Knut: The more we use bitcoin, KYC-free, between each other without paying taxes, and without inflation, the more we disarm the psychopaths. JB: Very, very slowly, one person at a time? Knut: Yes: Sooner or later, everyone wakes up to this. Anyone who attends these Bitcoin conferences can see for themselves how freakin’ superior bitcoin is to fiat money. JB: We went on a Bitcoin Walk in Helsinki yesterday. We stopped at a café — cute, small, two people working there, and 50 Bitcoiners show up. Obviously, everyone was gonna try to orange-pill this poor barista: wallets, zapping, the whole ordeal. Just think about it for a minute, 50 people, 5,000-10,000 sats zapped each, that’s a good couple of hundred bucks. Easy money, right? No, the dude had zero interest; he just wanted to serve coffee and get on with his day. Knut: Well, at dinner last night, we met a server who was exactly the other way around. She was super interested, “Oh yes, I’ve heard about bitcoin but I’ve never tried it, don’t know how it works.” From just a handful of us, she got some $50 — super happy about it! JB: So the guy we met yesterday just didn’t have curiosity awakened yet, whereas your server from last night did…? You think that’s the difference? Knut: Yes! The biggest reason for this is that to even grasp what Bitcoin is or what it does, you need to spend 100 hours on self-education… and most people aren’t willing to do that! The biggest hurdle to adoption is that people don’t have time; they don’t have 10,000 hours or whatever to invest into Bitcoin in order to fully understand it. JB: But we do have that time — certainly in a country like Finland. At least in the West, we work fewer hours, we have higher real wages, more leisure time. You can devote your time to whatever. Knut: Sure, but most people want to go to work, then go home and feel like they made a living for themselves when actually they worked three out of five days for the government, and another for the banks. That we still have money and time left is a testament to how strong the free market is: Everything good in the world comes from the free market. It’s a more powerful force than any totalitarian, self-pompos leader ever could be. Despite democracy, taxes and inflation, things move forward. We have progress. JB: Alright, wrapping up. What gives you hope? Where do you see the light? I don’t think the future is dark — it’s bright af — but the more you look out into fiatland, the worse things look. Knut: That’s because the future isn’t in fiat — it’s in Bitcoin. The future is bitcoin. It’s definitely this “Which Way, Western Man” meme. Either we’re in a world where everyone cooperates — like Booth says, eight billion people in service of eight billion people — or we’re going further down totalitarian oppression, darker and darker. If we didn’t have Bitcoin, I’d be much less hopeful for the future. Bitcoin exists, it’s easy to learn, and when a system is better, people make the change — put like that, why wouldn’t Bitcoin win? The world with Bitcoin is beautiful.

It also offered a convenient way around Amazon’s book publishing_ [_gatekeeping_](https://store.bitcoinmagazine.com/products/bitcoin-magazine-issue-29?srsltid=AfmBOopxByxzD_zcWTLjC6UiFYhxU2et-if_nSG_3t1pYAuPBBGBaDs-) _and meant that all books became print-on-demand.

This boosts sync speed, resilience, and allows full sovereignty without specific server dependency.\n*   **Full Node Integration Rework.** The old integration has been replaced with a simpler, more adaptable system. It’s not tied to a specific Bitcoin node fork, doesn’t need the node on the same machine as Wasabi, and requires no changes to the node’s setup.\n    *   \"Simply enable the RPC server on your node and point Wasabi to it,\" said the developers. This ensures all Bitcoin network activities—like retrieving blocks, fee estimations, block filters, and transaction broadcasting—go through your own node, avoiding reliance on third parties.\n*   **Create & Recover SLIP 39 Shares.** Users now create and recover wallets with multiple share backups using [SLIP 39](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.md) standard.\n\n> \"Special thanks to Trezor (SatoshiLabs) for sponsoring this amazing feature.\"\n\n*   **Nostr Update Manager.** This version implements a pioneering system with the Nostr protocol for update information and downloads, replacing reliance on GitHub. This enhances the project's resilience, ensuring updates even if GitHub is unavailable, while still verifying updates with the project's secure certificate.\n*   **Updated Avalonia to v11.2.7**, fixes for UI bugs (including restoring Minimize on macOS Sequoia).\n*   Added a **configurable third-party fallback for broadcasting transactions** if other methods fail.\n*   Replaced Windows Code Signing Certificate with Azure Trusted Signing.\n*   Many bug fixes, improved codebase, and enhanced CI pipeline.\n*   Added the option to avoid using any third-party Exchange Rate and Fee Rate providers (Wasabi can work without them).\n*   Rebuilt all JSON Serialization mechanisms avoiding default .NET converters. Serialization is now stricter.\n\n![Wasabi Wallet v2.6.0: First Version to Sync & Operate Without a Central Server](https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/content/images/2025/05/wasabi260.jpg)\n\n**Full Changelog**: [v2.5.1...v2.6.0](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/compare/v2.5.1...v2.6.0)\n\n[**Announcement**](https://njump.me/nevent1qqsp8cvfcz9788lmhad6ckvqg52r9z8fsl9dk3tcx3exjucv5qlc8vgpp4mhxue69uhkummn9ekx7mqzyzfm6rr08n96u3ec3vq6cm8qktqpxy2defxq34hzwyk5lac5qk3uxxetx9p) / [Archive](https://archive.is/V0VR4)  \n[**GitHub Repo**](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/releases/tag/v2.6.0)","sig":"0a6d92bad75987ecc585378f281f4f020ed57b6fd72fd99982c5ec5ab6c6dbc688ca3571d1039decd9a18d62b2358fb4b49f5c47159215a2ae6e6f8199243b93"}

It is incredibly easy to get bogged down in the details of how it works or different ways to use it. Enthusiasts, such as myself, often enjoy going down the deep rabbit hole of the potential of bitcoin, possible pitfalls and theoretical scenarios, power user techniques, and the developer ecosystem. If your first touch point with bitcoin is that type of content then it is only natural to be overwhelmed. While it is important that we have a thriving community of bitcoiners dedicated to these complicated tasks - the true beauty of bitcoin lies in its simplicity. Bitcoin is simply better money. It is the best money we have ever had.\n\n**Life is complicated. Life is hard. Life is full of responsibility and surprises.** Bitcoin allows us to focus on our lives while relying on a money that is simple. A money that is not controlled by any individual, company, or government. A money that cannot be easily seized or blocked. A money that cannot be devalued at will by a handful of corrupt bureaucrat who live hundreds of miles from us. A money that can be easily saved and should increase in purchasing power over time without having to learn how to \"build a diversified stock portfolio\" or hire someone to do it for us.\n\n**Bitcoin enables all of us to focus on our lives - our friends and family - doing what we love with the short time we have on this earth. Time is scarce. Life is complicated. Bitcoin is the most simple aspect of our complicated lives.** If we spend our scarce time working then we should be able to easily save that accrued value for future generations without watching the news or understanding complicated financial markets. Bitcoin makes this possible for anyone.\n\nYesterday was Mother's Day. Raising a human is complicated. It is hard, it requires immense personal responsibility, it requires critical thinking, but mothers figure it out, because it is worth it. Using and saving bitcoin is simple -  [simply install an app on your phone](https://werunbtc.com/phoenix?ref=discreetlog.com). Every mother can do it. Every person can do it.\n\n**Life is complicated. Life is beautiful.

Regulations often require companies to hold this information for a set number of years but in practice users should assume this data will be held indefinitely. Data is often stored insecurely, which results in frequent [hacks and leaks](https://www.newsweek.com/binance-hack-telegram-kyc-data-extortion-changpeng-zhao-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-1452989?ref=discreetlog.com).  \n*   KYC/AML data collection puts all honest users at risk of theft, extortion, and persecution while being ineffective at stopping crime. Criminals often use [counterfeit, bought, or stolen](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/19/for-200-you-can-trade-crypto-with-a-fake-id/?ref=discreetlog.com) credentials to get around the requirements. Criminals can buy \"verified\" accounts for as [little as $200](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/19/for-200-you-can-trade-crypto-with-a-fake-id/?ref=discreetlog.com). Furthermore, billions of people are excluded from financial services as a result of KYC/AML requirements.\n\nDuring the early days of bitcoin most services did not require this sensitive user data, but as adoption increased so did the surveillance measures. At this point, **most large bitcoin companies are collecting and storing massive lists of bitcoiners, our sensitive personal information, and our transaction history.**\n\n**Lists of Bitcoiners**\n\nKYC/AML policies are a direct attack on bitcoiners. Lists of bitcoiners and our transaction history will inevitably be used against us.  \n  \nOnce you are on a list with your bitcoin transaction history that record will always exist. Generally speaking, tracking bitcoin is based on probability analysis of ownership change. Surveillance firms use various heuristics to determine if you are sending bitcoin to yourself or if ownership is actually changing hands.  You can obtain better privacy going forward by using collaborative transactions such as coinjoin to break this probability analysis.  \n  \nFortunately, you can buy bitcoin without providing intimate personal information.

It benefits everyone if our energy infrastructure is as efficient and robust as possible. Unfortunately, broken incentives have led to increased regulation throughout the sector, incentivizing less efficient energy sources such as solar and wind at the detriment of more efficient alternatives.\n\nThe result has been less reliable energy infrastructure for all Americans and increased energy costs across the board. This naturally has a direct impact on bitcoin miners: increased energy costs make them less competitive globally.\n\nBitcoin mining represents a global energy market that does not require permission to participate. Anyone can plug a mining computer into power and internet to get paid the current dynamic market price for their work in bitcoin. Using cellphone or satellite internet, these mines can be located anywhere in the world, sourcing the cheapest power available.  \n  \nAbsent of regulation, bitcoin mining naturally incentivizes the build out of highly efficient and robust energy infrastructure. Unfortunately that world does not exist and burdensome regulations remain the biggest threat for US based mining businesses. Jurisdictional arbitrage gives miners the option of moving to a friendlier country but that naturally comes with its own costs.  \n  \nEnter AI. With the rapid development and release of AI tools comes the requirement of running massive datacenters for their models. Major tech companies are scrambling to secure machines, rack space, and cheap energy to run full suites of AI enabled tools and services. **The most valuable and powerful tech companies in America have stumbled into an accidental alliance with bitcoin miners: THE NEED FOR CHEAP AND RELIABLE ENERGY.**\n\nOur government is corrupt.

These plants emit significant amounts of CO2, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter, disproportionately impacting low-income communities near their locations. While there is broad consensus on the need to phase them out, progress has stalled. Surprisingly, a key barrier comes from an unexpected source: ideologically driven environmental NGOs. Despite advocating for cleaner energy, these groups have often opposed pragmatic solutions to reduce peaker plant reliance. By dismissing collaborations with utilities and energy companies as “greenwashing” outright, and refusing to engage with transitional technologies, they inadvertently prolong the lifespan of these polluting facilities. The Problem with “All or Nothing” Activism Many environmental NGOs operate under a rigid ideological framework that rejects any solution involving fossil fuel infrastructure, even if it demonstrably reduces emissions in the short term. This stance has led to the dismissal of viable bridge technologies, such as: Retrofitting Peaker Plants with Carbon Capture or Efficiency Upgrades In 2021, Duke Energy proposed retrofitting gas peaker plants in North Carolina with carbon capture systems and hybrid natural gas-battery systems to cut emissions by 50%. However, the Sierra Club and Sunrise Movement labeled the plan a “false climate solution,” arguing it legitimized fossil fuels. The project was shelved, leaving older, higher-emitting peakers in operation (source: Duke Energy Sustainability Report, 2022). Renewable-Natural Gas Hybrid Projects In California, where peaker plants contribute to poor air quality, startups like Mote Hydrogen sought to convert peakers to run on hydrogen-blended natural gas. While this would reduce NOx emissions by 30%, NGOs like 350.org criticized the effort as a “distraction from true renewables,” despite the lack of large-scale battery storage to replace peakers entirely (source: California Air Resources Board, 2023). These examples highlight a pattern: NGOs frequently attack projects that could meaningfully reduce emissions while offering no scalable alternatives. The result? Utilities default to maintaining outdated peaker plants rather than risk reputational damage from NGO backlash. Criticism Without Grid-Scale Alternatives The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that even in net-zero scenarios, natural gas will supply 15% of global electricity by 2040 due to grid stability needs (source: IEA World Energy Outlook, 2022). Transitioning away from peaker plants requires bridging solutions, yet NGOs often reject these outright. For instance, when NextEra Energy proposed replacing Florida peaker plants with solar farms paired with gas turbines (to ensure reliability during cloudy periods), the Center for Biological Diversity accused the utility of “greenwashing fossil fuel dependence.” No alternative plan was put forward, leaving aging peakers operational (source: Tampa Bay Times, 2021). Similarly, in New York, the closure of the Astoria peaker plant was delayed after local NGOs opposed a replacement facility using lower-emission turbines, demanding immediate 100% renewables—a goal the grid couldn’t yet support (source: NYISO Reliability Report, 2022). This absolutism ignores grid realities. Battery storage remains costly and limited in duration, leaving peaker plants as a necessary backstop. By blocking incremental improvements, NGOs ensure dirtier status-quo operations persist. Bitcoin Mining: A Pragmatic Alternative to Gas Peaker Plants in Texas While gas peaker plants have long been the default solution for grid stability during peak demand, Bitcoin mining has emerged as a scalable, cost-effective, and environmentally superior alternative—particularly in Texas. By acting as a flexible demand-side resource, Bitcoin mining has already demonstrated its ability to reduce reliance on peaker plants, even as ideologically driven NGOs and fossil fuel interests continue to oppose it. How Bitcoin Mining Replaces Gas Peaker Plants Gas peaker plants are designed to activate only during periods of extreme electricity demand, typically running fewer than 1,500 hours annually. However, their high costs, methane emissions, and environmental harms make them a poor long-term solution. Bitcoin mining, by contrast, provides grid operators with a unique tool: the ability to rapidly curtail energy consumption during peak demand, stabilizing the grid without the need for additional fossil fuel infrastructure. In Texas, this approach was pioneered by ERCOT CEO Brad Jones following the catastrophic 2021 Winter Storm Uri, which exposed the fragility of relying solely on peaker plants. Jones recognized that Bitcoin miners—unlike traditional industrial loads—could shut down operations within seconds, freeing up gigawatts of power for critical needs during emergencies. This flexibility allowed ERCOT to: Avoid building 3 GW of new gas peaker plants proposed by Berkshire Hathaway Energy, saving Texans an estimated $18 billion in infrastructure costs. Integrate more renewables by providing a “buyer of last resort” for excess solar and wind energy, which incentivizes renewable development. Reduce emissions by displacing peaker plants, which emit 0.4–0.6 tons of CO2 per MWh and leak methane even while idling. Peer-reviewed studies validate this strategy. Bruno et al. (2023) found that Bitcoin mining with demand response eliminated the need for gas peaker plants entirely while reducing annual carbon emissions by 48.67 million metric tons compared to baseline scenarios (Table 1). Rhodes et al. (2024) further concluded that Bitcoin mining’s flexibility enables grids to prioritize renewable energy over fossil fuels, accelerating decarbonization. Texas: A Proof of Concept By 2024, Bitcoin mining operations in Texas had grown to 3 GW of flexible load capacity, participating actively in ERCOT’s demand response programs. This resource proved critical during extreme weather events, such as the July 2023 heatwave, when miners voluntarily powered down to free up 1.2 GW of electricity—equivalent to the output of three large peaker plants. ERCOT has since reported zero blackouts despite record demand, crediting Bitcoin mining as a key factor in grid resilience. Dr Rian Dewhurst, of the Digital Assets Research Institute explains “Bitcoin mining doesn’t just stabilize the grid—it helps build a cleaner one. Grid operators no longer need expensive, polluting peaker plants idling on standby.” Opposition from Fossil Fuel Interests Despite its proven benefits, Bitcoin mining faces fierce opposition from entities invested in gas peaker plants. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which lobbied aggressively for $18 billion in peaker plant contracts, has funded lobbying efforts to discredit Bitcoin mining through proxies like Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. Patrick has repeatedly claimed Bitcoin “destabilizes grids,” a narrative debunked by ERCOT and academic research. This backlash underscores Bitcoin mining’s disruptive potential. As Dewhurst noted, “When you have 3 GW of flexible load, the business case for peaker plants evaporates.” Texas’ experience demonstrates that Bitcoin mining is not merely a theoretical alternative to gas peaker plants—it is a proven, scalable solution. By prioritizing grid needs over ideology, ERCOT has shown how collaboration with Bitcoin miners can phase out peaker plants while saving costs, cutting emissions, and accelerating the renewable transition. Toward Pragmatism: A Call for NGO Accountability The climate crisis demands urgency, but dogmatism and poor research stifles progress. To phase out peaker plants, NGOs must: Evaluate Collaborations Objectively Assess whether partnerships with utilities or energy firms yield measurable emissions reductions rather than reflexively crying “greenwash.” Engage with Grid Realities Acknowledge the role of transitional technologies until renewables and storage scale sufficiently. Prioritize Outcomes Over Ideology Recognize that the perfect is the enemy of the good — hybrid systems are better than perpetuating outdated peakers, and Bitcoin mining based solutions are better again, because they can accelerate the phasing out of gas peaker plants without any gas-powered backed to compensate for variable renewable energy intermittency. The perfect cannot be the enemy of the good. By clinging to purity tests, NGOs risk becoming unwitting allies of the very fossil fuel systems they seek to dismantle.

By contrast, MicroStrategy bet on bitcoin’s scarcity and long-term appreciation as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement. From a strategic perspective, it positioned itself as a hybrid — part technology company, part bitcoin exchange-traded proxy.\n\nFor Bitcoin advocates, this approach showcases the asset’s evolution. What was once dismissed as a speculative token has now become the core of a listed company’s balance sheet, signaling a shift in how corporations think about reserves. But the risks are as real as the potential rewards: volatility cuts both ways, and unlike bonds or cash, bitcoin can lose significant value in a short timeframe.\n\n**MSTR Stock Under Pressure**\n-----------------------------\n\nDespite the size of its bitcoin holdings, **MSTR stock** has struggled in recent months. Since peaking in July, it has dropped nearly 28%, sliding toward the $330 level. Several factors contribute to this decline. Valuation extremes have raised concerns, repeated exclusions from the S&P 500 have limited demand, and investor fatigue around the Bitcoin narrative has weighed on sentiment.\n\nThis divergence highlights an important lesson: fundamentals and perception don’t always align. A balance sheet with more bitcoin than Apple or Tesla’s cash reserves does not guarantee share price stability.\n\n**The Amplified Beta to Bitcoin**\n---------------------------------\n\nOne of the defining traits of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin treasury is its beta greater than one relative to bitcoin. That means MSTR stock doesn’t just follow bitcoin’s moves — it magnifies them. When bitcoin rallies, MSTR surges. But when bitcoin corrects, MSTR falls harder.\n\nThis amplification creates both opportunity and risk for investors. For those bullish on bitcoin, MSTR can deliver outsized returns. But for those caught in a downturn, the drawdowns can be even steeper than holding bitcoin directly.\n\n**Options Market and Yield Compression**\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe options market adds another layer of complexity. Products built on MSTR’s volatility, such as covered call ETFs, have seen yields collapse as premiums declined. When volatility spikes, these strategies look extraordinary. But as the market stabilizes, the income stream falls, leaving investors with exposure but less compensation for the risk.\n\n**Detecting Regime Shifts**\n---------------------------\n\nFor professional investors, the key is not predicting the next headline but detecting regime shifts in real time. Systematic models that track market structure — such as probability-based regime detection — can help identify when MSTR is in a bullish run versus when momentum has turned.\n\nThis type of approach doesn’t eliminate risk, but it provides discipline in a stock where emotional trading can be dangerous.\n\n![image](https://lightning.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image.png \"Opportunity and Risk: MSTR stock vs. Market sentiment 1\")\n\n**Conclusion: MSTR is Not Bitcoin Custody**\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThe MicroStrategy Bitcoin treasury represents both a milestone and a warning. It highlights bitcoin’s growing legitimacy as a corporate reserve asset, but it also underlines the risks of concentrating an entire strategy in one volatile asset. For investors, MSTR is not just another equity — it’s a bitcoin treasury strategy packaged as a stock.\n\nAnd one final point is crucial: buying MSTR is not the same as holding bitcoin. Shareholders remain exposed to corporate risk, equity market sentiment, and balance-sheet decisions made by executives. True sovereignty in bitcoin still comes only through [self-custody](https://lightning.news/why-bitcoin-ownership-demands-self-custody/) — holding your own keys, outside the liabilities of companies or intermediaries.","sig":"dcdf6dde8c4d6a326b5d019637c85be1587fd6fcc337343855f11f9796e9f334437b6d3e2526f14642f25368a714fbcc2ec5ea983d606127887b9be1b5d0d41d"}

For those who are unaware, Ark is a second layer scaling solution for bitcoin that leverages centralized servers, or Ark Service Providers (ASPs), to facilitate instant and cheap payments at scale. Currently, to my knowledge, there are two teams working to bring Ark to life; Second and Ark Labs.\n\nEven though ASPs are centralized the Ark protocol has shown promise because it has the intent of enabling individuals to unilaterally exit ASPs. If users can unilaterally exit without permission, the centralization v. decentralization tradeoff made by Ark can be incredibly powerful. And, as we can see from the mutinynet transaction above, it seems that unilateral exits are being delivered. A beautiful thing to see.\n\nWhat's even more beautiful is that, due to the very thoughtful design of the bitcoin protocol and the second layer protocols being built on top of bitcoin, every layer and protocol is interoperable with each other. Whether it's lightning, Liquid, eCash mints or Ark, users will be able to onboard to one of these protocols and interact with every other protocol. In the context of Ark and lightning, this was proven out last month at the Baltic Honey Badger conference in Riga where the Ark Labs team facilitated the vendor payments via BTCPay Servers catered to lightning users.\n\n[![Bitcoin Layer 2 Protocol Ark Making Progress](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-19-at-9.23.22---AM.png)](https://x.com/mariusoffchain/status/1954491306505277576?ref=tftc.io)\n\nvia [Marius Off Chain](https://x.com/mariusoffchain/status/1954491306505277576?ref=tftc.io)\n\nNot only were conference goers paying vendors from their lightning wallets with sats being settled over Ark on mainnet, some tested out ecash to Ark payments as well.\n\n[![Bitcoin Layer 2 Protocol Ark Making Progress](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-19-at-9.25.37---AM.png)](https://x.com/EricSirion/status/1954577791539654672?ref=tftc.io)\n\nvia [Eric Sirion](https://x.com/EricSirion/status/1954577791539654672?ref=tftc.io)\n\nThis validates a growing theme we've been excited about in this rag, on the podcast, and via our capital allocation strategy at [Ten31](https://www.ten31.xyz/?ref=tftc.io); a layered stack of interoperable protocols that anchor into the bitcoin protocol is how we get the best use cases and user experiences in the long-run. Ark, lightning, eCash mint protocols, Liquid and others can focus on their core competencies and develop specific use cases for specific needs while being able to connect to other second layer protocols using the lightning network as a connective tissue. No need for complex bridges, validator nodes or roll up schemes. Everything just works with each other. Mainly because of the design and maturation of the lightning network.\n\nDon't let people tell you that \"bitcoin's tech\" is boring and losing ground to other protocols. The base layer of bitcoin is certainly simple and \"boring\", but that simplicity and its boring nature is enabling more complex and robust protocols that can speak to each other to be built on top of it. The future of bitcoin tech is bright.\n\n### Government Housing Programs Have Created a Zombie Market\n\nMelody Wright revealed how government intervention has transformed the mortgage market into a dangerous game of musical chairs. She explained that banks retreated from mortgage lending after 2008 due to Basel III requirements, leaving non-bank lenders funded by government agencies to dominate the market. These lenders now issue FHA loans to borrowers with credit scores as low as 580 and just 3.5% down payments—a share of the market that Wright notes mirrors the subprime percentage before the last crisis.\n\n> \"This is insanity. And so what they did, many of us in the industry lobbied against this.\"- [Melody Wright](https://x.com/m3_melody?ref=tftc.io)\n\nWright detailed how the Biden administration's partial claim modification program allowed borrowers to repeatedly defer payments without proving ability to pay, creating what she calls \"rings of originators\" coaching investors to deliberately default. Starting October 2025, new FHA guardrails will require trial payments and exclude those with delinquent student loans, which Wright predicts will trigger material foreclosures by Q2 2026.\n\nCheck out the [full podcast here](https://youtu.be/fQaBJuLa1Dg?ref=tftc.io) for more on massive oversupply, why being a landlord isn't cool anymore, and the coming auto loan crisis.\n\n* * *\n\n### Headlines of the Day\n\nBig Mac Prices Highlight Money Deterioration - via [X](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1969011591505948798?ref=tftc.io)\n\n$4.35B Bitcoin and Ethereum Options Expire Today - via [X](https://x.com/WatcherGuru/status/1969007121799991309?ref=tftc.io)\n\nHarvard Holds More Bitcoin ETFs Than Google Shares - via [X](https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1969002798567068063?ref=tftc.io)\n\nBhutan Transfers 913 BTC Worth $107M - via [X](https://x.com/BitcoinNewsCom/status/1969000769547636762?ref=tftc.io)\n\nBitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits All-Time High - via [X](https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1968966012448940048?ref=tftc.io)\n\nChina's Gold Demand Strong Despite Record Prices - via [X](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1968846151194656784?ref=tftc.io)\n\n* * *\n\n### Bitcoin Has Crossed the Rubicon\n\nThis extended $75k–$110k range has caused some to wonder if the bull run is exhausted.

Put another way, all of the computers running the Hashcash SHA-256 algorithm and pointing their hashes at the bitcoin network are, collectively, producing 1 SEXTILLION HASHES **_PER SECOND_** in hopes of finding the hash below the current difficulty target that enables them to add a block of transactions to the ledger. Truly awe inspiring when you take a step back and think about it.\n\nThe collective capital, energy and risk that is taken on a daily basis to acquire bitcoins by participating in an open and free market for transaction validation and ordering that ensures that individuals who are so motivated have access to an open and permissionless monetary system with a hard capped supply and no trusted third parties is mind boggling. The most impressive part of this feat is that it materialized in a completely emergent and grassroots fashion. Sure, there are massive corporations that now exist with the sole intent of mining bitcoin at massive scales, but the path to this point was paved by a collective of individuals who plugged computers in, ran some software that enabled them to mine bitcoin, noticed inefficiencies and ways they could turn them into efficiencies, and built a multi-billion dollar industry to achieve those efficiencies.\n\nThe breadth of the bitcoin mining landscape spans from bookcases housing [Bitaxes](https://bitaxe.org/?ref=tftc.io) to gigawatt scale data centers participating in demand response programs to help balance the most important energy infrastructure that we depend on every day; grids. It's a beautiful thing.\n\nAnother thing that this milestone screams to me is just how resilient the bitcoin network is. For those who have forgotten, the Chinese government banned bitcoin mining in the Spring/Summer of 2021. As a result, the network hashrate fell by more than 50% from ~170 EH/s to ~83 EH/s.\n\n[![The Bitcoin Network Just Reached An Insane Mining Milestone](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-10.32.50---PM.png)](https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/hashrate-difficulty?ref=tftc.io#all)\n\nvia [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/hashrate-difficulty?ref=tftc.io#all)\n\nIn just over 4 years hashrate has not only recovered from the post-China ban lows, it has increased by **12.3x**. Simply remarkable. This is where the signal is today. Mining is the heartbeat of the bitcoin network. All of the miners producing 1 sextillion hashes per second exist to aggregate valid transactions in blocks and add them to the ledger every ten minutes on average. Individually dealing with infrastructure costs, execution risks, unknown competitors entering the market and pushing hashrate up, beholden to the whims of bitcoin price volatility and (funnily enough) the weather.\n\nBitcoin is doing just fine. Don't let anyone tell you differently.\n\n### The Deliberate Middle Class Destruction\n\nTom Luongo revealed how banking regulations systematically prevent middle-class Americans from building wealth through homeownership.

It benefits everyone if our energy infrastructure is as efficient and robust as possible. Unfortunately, broken incentives have led to increased regulation throughout the sector, incentivizing less efficient energy sources such as solar and wind at the detriment of more efficient alternatives.\n\nThe result has been less reliable energy infrastructure for all Americans and increased energy costs across the board. This naturally has a direct impact on bitcoin miners: increased energy costs make them less competitive globally.\n\nBitcoin mining represents a global energy market that does not require permission to participate. Anyone can plug a mining computer into power and internet to get paid the current dynamic market price for their work in bitcoin. Using cellphone or satellite internet, these mines can be located anywhere in the world, sourcing the cheapest power available.  \n  \nAbsent of regulation, bitcoin mining naturally incentivizes the build out of highly efficient and robust energy infrastructure. Unfortunately that world does not exist and burdensome regulations remain the biggest threat for US based mining businesses. Jurisdictional arbitrage gives miners the option of moving to a friendlier country but that naturally comes with its own costs.  \n  \nEnter AI. With the rapid development and release of AI tools comes the requirement of running massive datacenters for their models. Major tech companies are scrambling to secure machines, rack space, and cheap energy to run full suites of AI enabled tools and services. **The most valuable and powerful tech companies in America have stumbled into an accidental alliance with bitcoin miners: THE NEED FOR CHEAP AND RELIABLE ENERGY.**\n\nOur government is corrupt.

At Blackstone, he saw oil and gas credit deals give way to ESG-driven renewables with poor returns, while 2020’s money printing highlighted fiat’s flaws. Bitcoin offered a scarce, durable alternative, and stranded natural gas provided the cheapest power to mine it. 360 Energy began by buying unattractive wells and converting gas into low-cost Bitcoin, later evolving into a service model for producers through infrastructure sales and rentals. Adoption is accelerating, especially in regions with strict flaring rules, and Sean believes major oil companies will integrate Bitcoin mining into drill programs within four years.\n\nBest Quotes\n-----------\n\n*   “We were spending all this brain damage, all this effort on structuring creative deals to make 10%, but someone could print money with the push of a button. Once you learn about Bitcoin’s 21 million, it changes everything.”\n*   “If you’re mining Bitcoin, your largest cost is electricity. How do you survive? Same as oil: the lowest-cost producer wins.”\n*   “These equity returns were zero until year 15. Even then, 6–7%. And that’s with tax incentives. Without them, they were negative.”\n*   “We bought unattractive wells cheap, eliminated pipeline costs, and monetized the gas with Bitcoin mining. Suddenly, break-even assets had real upside.”\n*   “In oil and gas, people thought fracking was crazy, until it worked. Bitcoin mining will spread the same way: one operator proves it, and everyone copies.”\n*   “If we could do AI computing in the oilfield, we would. But Bitcoin is the only workload that runs on Starlink, tolerates downtime, and scales in 1-megawatt chunks.”\n*   “The Bitcoin on our balance sheet gets almost zero credit from lenders. They say, ‘You don’t have much cash.’ But it’s the best collateral on earth.”\n*   “In Wyoming, a large producer shut in oil for over a year because they couldn’t flare gas. With our units, they can flow 200 barrels a day again. That’s the power of Bitcoin mining.”\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nSean’s story embodies the convergence of Wall Street, energy finance, and Bitcoin’s disruptive logic. Where Blackstone’s credit models hit diminishing returns amid fiat inflation and ESG fads, Bitcoin mining offered both higher economics and deeper alignment with physical energy systems. By reframing stranded gas as a competitive edge, 360 Energy is pioneering a new bridge between oilfields and digital money. The path forward lies in demonstrating reliability, building financing models, and expanding into flaring-constrained regions. If early momentum continues, Bitcoin mining could graduate from fringe solution to standard oilfield tool, and eventually reshape how drill programs themselves are planned.\n\nTimestamps\n----------\n\n0:00 - Investment Banking and Energy Finance Experience  \n4:30 - Deal Structure and Investment Focus at Blackstone  \n7:27 - COVID Impact and Shift to Renewables  \n9:51 - Bitcoin Discovery and Orange-Pilling Journey  \n13:18 - Connecting Energy Finance to Bitcoin's Value Proposition  \n17:20 - Partnership with Chris and 360 Energy Formation  \n21:29 - Renewable Energy Economics vs Bitcoin Mining  \n25:27 - Natural Gas Strategy and Asset Selection  \n29:14 - Low-Cost Producer Economics  \n32:12 - Asset Acquisition and Valuation Strategy  \n37:59 - Economic Modeling and Capital Requirements  \n42:22 - Volatility Comparison: Natural Gas vs Bitcoin  \n45:29 - Well Decline Curves and Mining Capacity Planning  \n50:28 - Transition to Service Business Model  \n55:54 - Industry Adoption and Bitcoin Perception  \n59:36 - Equipment Financing and Customer Decision Factors  \n1:07:23 - Industry Dynamics and Risk-Taking Culture  \n1:11:49 - Credit Facilities and Banking Relationships  \n1:18:58 - Strategic Focus and Geographic Expansion  \n1:21:48 - Future Industry Integration\n\nTranscript\n----------\n\n(00:05) Sean, welcome to the center of hash. Thank you. It's good to be here. Your former home, Bitcoin Park. I was going to say it's good to be back in the com or Bitcoin park. We miss you guys. We've only been away for a few weeks, but I know there's a a vacuum that we need to fill a void. Yep. How are things going at the new office? Oh, they're great.  \n(00:28) You know, it's uh it's sad to leave this space, but it's good to have our own space. We're growing the team a lot, so it's nice to have conference rooms to take calls and things like that. Signs of success. Yeah. Yeah, we hope so. You know, the team's grown a lot, putting deals out, so blown and going. Well, Chris, your co-founder and partner at 360 Energy, recorded in July.  \n(00:54) Um, and he and I were catching up and I suggested that we should get you on as well. You have a very different background from Chris and wanted to start out just talking about your the history in the oil and gas space on the finance side and how you came to be working on Bitcoin and specifically Bitcoin mining. You were formerly at Blackstone.  \n(01:18) So just talk a little bit about and then investment banking at credit Swiss for that both on the oil and gas side energy energy side I guess but yeah talk a little bit about your history what you were doing and how you ultimately decided to become interested in Bitcoin and then and then work on Bitcoin mining. Yeah definitely.  \n(01:42) So started at Credit Swiss in the oil and gas group in Houston, went to school in Dallas. Um, and that was like we talked about earlier, led ship for finance. You know, being an analyst in investment bank is a lot of grunt work. Um, but you do learn a lot over your two-year period there after what years was that? That was 16 to 18 in Houston.  \n(02:01) I've done my pledge ship in investment banking as well. New York 2006 to 2009 bank. So that was a pretty wild time and I know what it's like. Yeah. Yeah. Um so that was great but the goal is always to get to the buy side. Um so did two years there and then moved to GSO which was the credit arm of Blackstone. It's rebranded to Blackstone Credit now. Um in New York 25 person team across New York and Houston.  \n(02:28) Um and we were investing when I first joined in all oil and gas companies. So investing across the capital stack mostly preferred equity down to or up to senior secured debt. Um and you know day one it was all oil and gas. So, a lot of upstream deals, some mid-stream deals, a little bit of OFS, and it was just if you need capital as a business to, you know, expand your drilling program or buy more equipment, um, we would be a capital provider to help them do that and make return for our LPS. Um, so that was a great  \n(03:03) experience. You know, it's it's a very intense environment for sure. Uh, a lot of very smart people and I learned a ton. You know, I was there for six years overall. um learned a lot in my first three years.  \n(03:20) It's almost like the first two years are almost like investment banking all over again, but with a different skill set. You're just, you know, working very hard. Um long hours as well, but it's your LP's capital you're investing. So, the the standard is a bit higher on you have to be really sure you're right. Um at an investment bank, it's kind of you're being salesy, right? Um so, that was a great experience.  \n(03:47) Um so a question there one just total as an aside what does GSO stand for? Uh the three founders so Goodman uh Smith and Orover and that was a unit within Blackstone. Yeah. So those three guys were DJ credit squeeze guys back in the 90s. They started GSO early 2000s I believe um I think 2004 and then Blackstone bought GSO in 2008.  \n(04:14) So, and then specifically talk about the like in terms of the deals that you would work on, were you typically working on primary equity financings, credit financing all throughout the capital structure and just the nature of the type of deals that you would yeah have experience with. An example, it was mostly credit focused because GSO was a credit shop.  \n(04:36) Um, we would do minority common equity, but we wouldn't do control common equity. If there was anything controlled, that would go to the private equity group. So, Blackstone kind of has many business segments, right? Private equity, real estate, and then GSO was the credit arm.  \n(04:53) So, a typical deal, for example, um, uh, a midstream or sorry, an upstream operator in the Perian needed $100 million to go drill 10 more wells. We would give them a term loan, $100 million term loan, pretty expensive capital. You know, we targeted mid- teens and then we might co-invest 10 million of common equity alongside. And were these typically I mean presumably if they're getting a $100 million term loan, these are wellestablished companies are really often public companies, private mix. It was a mix. I would say most of the deals were private companies. We would  \n(05:24) do some public stuff. The biggest deal I worked on was a $1.6 $6 billion preferred equity investment into a system called Target Badlands. So Target is a massive mid-stream company publicly traded and they wanted to monetize a part of their Bacan assets, their midstream assets there.  \n(05:47) So we bought a 45% interest preferred interest um for 1.6 billion. You know, that's an example of a a deal we would do with some public guys in Bakans, North Dakota owns oil and gas. Yep. Oil and gas North Dakota. Um, so a gathering system means they have the pipes that actually connect to the wells.  \n(06:05) So they're the ones that build out to the pad, connect to the actual wells, and get those hydrocarbons to market, both oil and gas. And so you were there for six years. You mentioned the first two years being very similar to an investment banking first few years, but in terms of expos","sig":"e371e24d4f785374b2c8a9f553ea7c7e00d616a0288d272ff4c2c47a679169eea6b911240eb0e72049a3e24daed30db976567690c0649b069f33699af632dec0"}

It is also an effective gauge of a media outlet’s neutrality, investigative rigor, and thorough fact-checking because it is a complex, polarizing topic that demands unbiased analysis and meticulous research to navigate its technical, economic, and environmental dimensions accurately. Outlets that excel, such as Forbes with its detailed reports integrating peer-reviewed research on Bitcoin mining’s environmental benefits, demonstrate a commitment to neutral appraisal and depth, suggesting broader journalistic integrity. Conversely, outlets like The New York Times show clear evidence of employing a morality play framing with heroes and villains, which tends to work against nuance and leads to looking for data to support the narrative, rather than the other way around. The Economist, marked by persistent falsehoods, reveals biases and lapses in fact-checking that likely extend to other subjects. The topic’s technical nature and the diversity of stakeholder interests—ranging from environmentalists to financial innovators—require outlets to conduct independent and critical analysis, and verify claims rigorously, making their Bitcoin reporting a good litmus test for overall reliability. Methodology This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the media reliability index for major outlets’ coverage of Bitcoin, as of June 11, 2025. The index evaluates five sub-measures: 1. Ability to Conduct Novel Research (vs. relying on cut-and-paste reporting), 2. Depth of Thinking (over sensationalist headlines), 3. Neutral Appraisal (presenting a balanced view), 4. Avoidance of Groupthink (challenging prevailing narratives), 5. Speed in Overcoming Negativity Bias (moving past initial bias toward an evidence-based assessment). Coverage of any novel technology is generally a good way to stress-test reliability of media, being the area where faults in fact checking are most likely to be revealed. We can see this in media coverage across time of novel technologies including the bicycle, the radio and the Internet, all of which revealed where media outlets were more likely to favor recycling of other journalists’ work, sensational headlines and non-neutral appraisals with a general disinclination to challenge prevailing narratives for some time. Each was scored on a 0-10 scale. The following sections detail the methodology, findings, and commentary, ensuring a thorough understanding of the results, with specific recalibrations for BBC and New York Times Survey Scope The analysis began by collecting posts from July 2022- June 2025 for a range of mainstream media outlets that regularly comment on Bitcoin: Verge, WIRED, The Guardian, New York Times, The Economist, The Financial Times, Bloomberg, BBC, Forbes, Reuters, CNBC, and The Street. The posts were analyzed for sentiments—criticisms, praises, or neutral mentions—related to each outlet’s Bitcoin coverage. Next, scores were inferred based on the content of each article from each media outlet. Detailed Findings The resulting media reliability index is presented in the table below, ranked from best to worst based on average scores.

Bloomberg: The coverage stands out for recognizing Bitcoin’s environmental advantages, such as reporting on miners utilizing Iceland’s renewable energy surplus, with Neutral Appraisal (8/10) as the most salient, averaging 7.4. Reuters: The coverage mirrors Bloomberg’s nuanced framing of Bitcoin mining, exemplified by reporting on MARA’s methane emission reduction efforts, and use of stranded energy in Iceland, with Neutral Appraisal (8/10) driving the average of 7.4. CNBC: The coverage offers a balanced perspective, notably acknowledging Bitcoin’s contribution to African renewables, with Overcoming Negativity Bias (6/10) as the most relevant, averaging 6.4. BBC: The coverage features a positive report on Bitcoin mining’s role in rural electrification, with Overcoming Negativity Bias (6/10) as the key improvement. The history of non-nuanced framing, including use of non-peer reviewed science for sensationalist headlines dragged down the score, averaging 4.8. The Financial Times: The coverage reflects a mixed track record, with a pro-Bitcoin ESG article in December 2023 undermined by later critiques, with Neutral Appraisal (3/10) highlighting the inconsistency, averaging 4.2. The Guardian: The coverage is marred by significant errors, and lack of fact checking such as mislabeling gas plant noise as cryptocurrency mining sound, with Neutral Appraisal (2/10) as the most critical weakness, averaging 2.8. WIRED: The coverage includes instances of many misleading and factually incorrect claims. For example, WIRED claimed that Bitcoin mining destabilizes grids, despite the fact this has been debunked in peer reviewed research (their article was also community noted). Neutral Appraisal (2/10) was their lowest rating, averaging 2.8. New York Times: The coverage reveals a consistent framing of Bitcoin mining as a villain in a morality play. Of particular note was a 2023 article which selectively used data, and misusing marginal emissions accounting to create a heavily distorted view of Bitcoin mining. Neutral Appraisal (1/10) as the most glaring deficiency, averaging 2.6. The Verge: The coverage exhibits severe factual errors, such as unsupported claims about IMF paper momentum, with Avoidance of Groupthink (1/10) as the most prominent failing, averaging 2.0. The Economist: The coverage reflects the most pronounced falsehoods about Bitcoin, with Overcoming Negativity Bias (1/10) as the most critical shortcoming, averaging 1.8. Implications and Use as a Reliability Tool This index reflects how each outlet handles Bitcoin coverage, providing insight into their broader journalistic reliability. Higher-scoring outlets like Forbes and The Street demonstrate a commitment to balanced, informed reporting and re-evaluation of previous articles based on new evidence. Less reliable outlets like The Economist and The Verge show persistent issues with bias and accuracy. The BBC’s rating of 4.8 acknowledges its recent positive article on Bitcoin Mining but notes that this is an outlier in an overall trend of inaccuracies and non-objective appraisal. The NYTimes’ score of 2.6 highlights its lack of nuance in appraising Bitcoin, and evidence of using data selectively to suit a narrative, plus the impact of its much criticized article on Bitcoin mining in 2023."],["image","https://batcoinz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/LogoMakr-5Ig93s.png"],["client","Pure Signal"],["t","Bitcoin"]],"content":"![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdlrTKx-ioau_IUyzqhEput4DcSRpyx45LHb2nqI9RzJUOSLjytoaKtXE88vY_ZNE-XyXK6Tg4CJhkScjtXAYV75knzrXVbQmdRQAvRzUPxoKJziPGr4yIoq09fsAW7g6lYU-SZ_w?key=rR-xu87mGFzliWEIzUWVOw)\n\n### Overview\n\nBitcoin coverage is a strong gauge of media integrity because it exposes outlets that prioritize sensationalism over facts, lack technical understanding, or succumb to ideological/industry bias.\n\nIt is also an effective gauge of a media outlet’s neutrality, investigative rigor, and thorough fact-checking because it is a complex, polarizing topic that demands unbiased analysis and meticulous research to navigate its technical, economic, and environmental dimensions accurately. \n\nOutlets that excel, such as Forbes with its detailed reports integrating peer-reviewed research on Bitcoin mining’s environmental benefits, demonstrate a commitment to neutral appraisal and depth, suggesting broader journalistic integrity.

The program offers 2-5 BTC in funding, a four-week residency and access to Bitcoin developers and operators, targeting start-ups with market-ready solutions in financial services and technology. Michael Tanguma, founder of Early Riders and Onramp, a Bitcoin financial services firm, told Bitcoin Magazine, “We focus on consumer investments that have commercial viability today — things that people want and will pay for today.” The Stables accelerator targets start-ups addressing immediate market needs, particularly in Bitcoin financial services, leveraging multi-institution custody for lending, bit bonds, and real estate debt facilities. It has a focus on regions like Latin America, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific, where fiat-to-Bitcoin on-ramps are critical for adoption. It seeks consumer-focused solutions like secure custody, inheritance planning and seamless fiat-to-BTC conversions, addressing challenges where users struggle to enter safely and hold bitcoin. “Historical examples are Lightning and payments. People don’t really use them. We want them to be used, and on the margins they are, but people still have trouble getting into Bitcoin — meaning turning their local fiat currency into BTC, then custodying it in a safe way, thinking about inheritance and all those examples,” Tanguma explained about the type of start-ups they are interested in. He added that, “Google is integrating USDC stablecoins into their new AI programs — we know it will make sense for economic activity in a digital world, especially with AI, to be using satoshis instead because it has a better design surface and more programmability.” The Stables is accepting submissions immediately, selecting five top candidates for a demo day with Early Riders’ limited partners and advisors. The winner receives between 2 and 5 BTC, based on bitcoin’s price and project needs, plus a four-week residency in Texas. The facility provides childcare, wellness amenities and a rural setting to foster focus. The program will run annually, with the initial cohort scheduled for summer 2026. Early Riders emphasizes Bitcoin-driven efficiency: “When you have a cost of capital that is bitcoin… growing on an annual basis anywhere between 30 to 50% a year… you just get really efficient with how you hire, the kind of tools you use,” Tanguma told Bitcoin Magazine. This approach, he said, helps Bitcoin start-ups prioritize sound unit economics over fiat-driven growth. The program is global, with Early Riders’ investments all over the world. “This is a global opportunity. We have a global footprint with investments in the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. We want to encourage Bitcoin investors and rationalists — people who don’t want their money debased — to get excited, learn more and reach out to see how we can plug them in,” Tanguma told Bitcoin Magazine. The accelerator offers a follow-on funding pathway with access to over 50 investors. Tanguma’s experience at Unchained and with high-net-worth clients at Ten31 shapes the focus on multi-institution custody, which he described as offering “10x the security of self-custody but at one-tenth the friction or time.” The Stables aims to support start-ups driving Bitcoin adoption through practical solutions.

[Cynthia Lummis](https://bitcoinnews.com/adoption/cynthia-lummis-commends-bitcoin/) (R-WY), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH), Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Rep. Nick Begich (R-AK), Rep. Pat Harrigan (R-NC), House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), House Financial Services Chair French Hill (R-AR), and Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN).\n\nOn the industry side, participants included Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy and one of Bitcoin’s biggest champions, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel, and other execs from mining and digital asset companies.\n\nThe meetings were hosted by advocacy groups like the Digital Chamber, the [Digital Power Network](https://x.com/DigitalPowerUS/status/1968054179479613704), and the new Treasury Council.\n\n![strategic bitcoin reserve meetings](https://bitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/strategic-bitcoin-reserve-meetings.jpg \"US Lawmakers and Digital Asset Execs Meet to Push for Bitcoin Reserve 6\")\n\n_Political figures and well-known digital asset execs took part in the meetings_\n\nThe core proposal, outlined in the BITCOIN Act, would have the U.S. government build a strategic reserve of up to 1 million bitcoin, just like how gold has been held as a national reserve asset.\n\nSupporters say this would strengthen America’s financial position and ensure the country is a leader in the future of digital assets.\n\n_“Legislators and the executives at yesterday’s roundtable agree, there is a need \\[for\\] a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve law to ensure its longevity for America’s financial future,”_ said Hailey Miller, Director of Government Affairs at the Digital Power Network.\n\nThe bill, [reintroduced](https://bitcoinnews.com/adoption/the-bitcoin-act-is-back/) by Sen. Lummis in March, builds on an executive order signed by President Donald Trump which first established the concept of a bitcoin reserve and barred the government from selling bitcoin seized in criminal or civil cases.\n\nLummis’s bill goes further — not just holding seized coins, but also buying more.\n\nAccording to the proposal, the government could use “budget-neutral strategies” to fund the purchases, including revaluing gold certificates and earnings from Federal Reserve banks.\n\n_**Related: [US to Use Tariffs and Gold Revaluation to Build Bitcoin Reserves](https://bitcoinnews.com/adoption/tariffs-gold-strategic-bitcoin-reserves/)**_\n\nMichael Saylor, whose company is the largest public holder of bitcoin with over 638,000 BTC, has been leading the charge. At the roundtable, Saylor said Bitcoin is more than just an investment.\n\n_“Bitcoin represents economic freedom,”_ he said, urging the U.S. to adopt it as a reserve asset to maintain global financial leadership.\n\nSaylor also noted that Bitcoin is already changing the global financial system, and the U.S. must move fast if it wants to stay ahead.\n\n> [](https://twitter.com/BitcoinNewsCom/status/1968802188576063539)\n\nOther executives, including Thiel and Tom Lee of BitMine, agreed and joined the Treasury Council in sending a letter to Congress to pass the bill. The letter said a bitcoin reserve would “hedge against systemic risks” and keep America at the top of the financial world.\n\nThe roundtables also showed growing support within the Republican Party. Speaker Mike Johnson said House Republicans will work “hand in glove” with the industry.\n\n_“We’re in this together,”_ Johnson said at a Bitcoin Voter PAC event after meeting with digital asset execs and lawmakers.\n\n_“(Congress) relies upon the insight and expertise (of the members of the industry) to be able to have policy that allows for further growth and advancement of the industry.”_","sig":"c66ddab773148e4ae09a07489d3fd1e912d716f156e7a641195c7b32534a902da2cabed36ea2d98aa257eff0ed5080a46ff836564ab2836c877f72b00262c523"}

Put another way, all of the computers running the Hashcash SHA-256 algorithm and pointing their hashes at the bitcoin network are, collectively, producing 1 SEXTILLION HASHES **_PER SECOND_** in hopes of finding the hash below the current difficulty target that enables them to add a block of transactions to the ledger. Truly awe inspiring when you take a step back and think about it.\n\nThe collective capital, energy and risk that is taken on a daily basis to acquire bitcoins by participating in an open and free market for transaction validation and ordering that ensures that individuals who are so motivated have access to an open and permissionless monetary system with a hard capped supply and no trusted third parties is mind boggling. The most impressive part of this feat is that it materialized in a completely emergent and grassroots fashion. Sure, there are massive corporations that now exist with the sole intent of mining bitcoin at massive scales, but the path to this point was paved by a collective of individuals who plugged computers in, ran some software that enabled them to mine bitcoin, noticed inefficiencies and ways they could turn them into efficiencies, and built a multi-billion dollar industry to achieve those efficiencies.\n\nThe breadth of the bitcoin mining landscape spans from bookcases housing [Bitaxes](https://bitaxe.org/?ref=tftc.io) to gigawatt scale data centers participating in demand response programs to help balance the most important energy infrastructure that we depend on every day; grids. It's a beautiful thing.\n\nAnother thing that this milestone screams to me is just how resilient the bitcoin network is. For those who have forgotten, the Chinese government banned bitcoin mining in the Spring/Summer of 2021. As a result, the network hashrate fell by more than 50% from ~170 EH/s to ~83 EH/s.\n\n[![The Bitcoin Network Just Reached An Insane Mining Milestone](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-10.32.50---PM.png)](https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/hashrate-difficulty?ref=tftc.io#all)\n\nvia [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/hashrate-difficulty?ref=tftc.io#all)\n\nIn just over 4 years hashrate has not only recovered from the post-China ban lows, it has increased by **12.3x**. Simply remarkable. This is where the signal is today. Mining is the heartbeat of the bitcoin network. All of the miners producing 1 sextillion hashes per second exist to aggregate valid transactions in blocks and add them to the ledger every ten minutes on average. Individually dealing with infrastructure costs, execution risks, unknown competitors entering the market and pushing hashrate up, beholden to the whims of bitcoin price volatility and (funnily enough) the weather.\n\nBitcoin is doing just fine. Don't let anyone tell you differently.\n\n### The Deliberate Middle Class Destruction\n\nTom Luongo revealed how banking regulations systematically prevent middle-class Americans from building wealth through homeownership. He explained that Dodd-Frank and Elizabeth Warren's CFPB created barriers making it nearly impossible for small business owners to access mortgages, even with strong incomes. Luongo shared his personal struggle trying to refinance his Florida home, describing how underwriters are \"working overtime every freaking day to deny people loans.\"\n\n> \"The 30-year fixed rate mortgage says... build a business that's thrown off 7% a year, and your business is paying for your home.\" - [Tom Luongo](https://x.com/TFL1728?ref=tftc.io)\n\nThis deliberate destruction serves those who want Americans to \"own nothing and be happy.\" Luongo emphasized that restoring access to the 30-year mortgage through Fannie and Freddie's recapitalization is essential for rebuilding middle-class wealth and communities.\n\nCheck out the [full podcast here](https://youtu.be/vbQ4bmRVaSQ?ref=tftc.io) for more on Charlie Kirk's impact, RICO cases against radical groups and Europe's military weakness.\n\n* * *\n\n### Headlines of the Day\n\nTrump Hails US-China Trade Breakthrough - via [X](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1967596858941096032?ref=tftc.io)\n\nTrump Advocates Semiannual Corporate Reporting - via [X](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1967584886132445580?ref=tftc.io)\n\nPayPal Integrates Bitcoin into P2P Payments - via [X](https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1967577646512140518?ref=tftc.io)\n\nMicroStrategy Buys 525 More Bitcoin - via [X](https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1967560016631943534?ref=tftc.io)\n\nHyperscale Data Launches $100M Bitcoin Treasury - via [X](https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1967540912688701731?ref=tftc.io)\n\nFed Set for First Rate Cut This Year - via [X](https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1967506296405705186?ref=tftc.io)\n\n* * *\n\n### Bitcoiners: Don’t let nefarious actors steal your sats.\n\nSLNT's patented Faraday backpacks, sleeves, and dry bags secure your hardware wallet or electronics against hackers and solar flares.\n\nBlock WiFi, GPS, RFID, and EMPs with our MIL-STD compliant tech.

This energy boom, however, has also led to a significant **rise in debt**, mainly from Chinese loans and foreign companies that financed dam construction. This situation is now pushing authorities to seek new sources of revenue through the mining sector.\n\nElectricity accounted for **26%** of Laos’ total exports last year, according to government trade data. However, the initiative faces structural challenges: during the dry season, the country is often forced to buy electricity from neighboring nations, particularly **Thailand**.\n\n### **Environmental criticism**\n\nEnvironmental concerns present another obstacle for Laos’ plans. **Witoon Permpongsacharoen**, director of the Mekong Energy and Ecology Network, stated:\n\n> > “Laos allowing electricity to be used for cryptocurrency mining is clearly not something driven by internal conditions. It stems from the fact that Laos is heavily indebted and unable to pay off its debts.”\n\nReports indicate that the dams have caused serious environmental impacts: interrupted rivers, reduced downstream crops, damage to fishing activities, and thousands of displaced people. **Pianporn Dites** of International Rivers highlighted that promises of compensation for displaced communities have largely gone unfulfilled.\n\nDespite criticism, Laos aims to become a fully digital economy by 2030, granting licenses to local companies for mining and trading digital assets, while attempting to regulate Chinese miners who moved operations to the country after China’s 2021 ban.\n\nThe post [Laos looks to mining to harness excess hydropower](https://atlas21.com/laos-looks-to-mining-to-harness-excess-hydropower/) appeared first on [Atlas21](https://atlas21.com).","sig":"254808319fedd6e9ca3b49e8c3cbf552a6c3737896b4d07f1da9d370628d123f1a8bfd661cbd011cddc16accb541bac3888d52169eda21d7712893da3e1a6be8"}

A Reddit user, a former international contractor, [reported](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1nas7yi/bank_is_closing_my_account_due_to_biometrics/) being forced to return to Vietnam in person to avoid the closure of his **HSBC** account, as remote solutions for biometric verification were not available.\n\n_“This is a very insidious way to do a bail-in while also increasing the surveillance state,”_ [commented](https://www.tftc.io/which-way-anon/) **Marty Bent**.\n\n[According](https://x.com/DSBatten/status/1968444987625853214) to **Daniel Batten**, researcher and co-founder of CH4 Capital, these measures give the Vietnamese central bank _“next-gen financial surveillance ability.”_\n\nThe Hanoi government justified the introduction of the new rules by citing the increased use of generative AI and sophisticated spoofing techniques to bypass banking security systems. Last May, local police dismantled a laundering network that used fake facial scans and had moved approximately 1,000 billion Vietnamese dong ($39 million).\n\nThe new regulations require facial biometric authentication for first-time registration and online transfers over 10 million dong ($379), while combined transactions exceeding 20 million dong ($758) always require biometric verification.\n\nThe post [Vietnam closes 86 million bank accounts over missing biometric verification](https://atlas21.com/vietnam-closes-86-million-bank-accounts-over-missing-biometric-verification/) appeared first on [Atlas21](https://atlas21.com).","sig":"70a3980e84c0d7556dcff67a6a703546586d27b91e3eb9be3edabed9e90ad2f00ddf19e88de3a9f2b3f011b88a4950ef8416b837a7c92bef8fc71dad0445bb55"}

The move is a big step for one of Europe’s largest financial institutions into the digital asset space, with Spain to follow in the coming weeks.\n\nThe new service allows Openbank customers to buy, sell, and hold bitcoin, as well as four top altcoins — Ethereum, Litecoin, Polygon, and Cardano — directly on the bank’s investment platform.\n\nThe service sits alongside Openbank’s traditional investment products such as stocks, funds, ETFs, and robo-advisory services.\n\nBy trading within its own platform, Openbank eliminates the need for customers to transfer funds to third-party exchanges. The service is also under the European Union’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets ([MiCA](https://bitcoinnews.com/markets/new-eu-framework-mica-benefit-bitcoin/)) regulation, which provides legal clarity and investor protection across the bloc.\n\nCoty de Monteverde, Head of Crypto at Grupo Santander, said:\n\n> _“By incorporating the main cryptocurrencies into our investment platform, we are responding to the demand of some of our customers and continue to strengthen a broad range of products and services through an agile, simple technology platform backed by one of the world’s leading financial groups.”_\n\nOpenbank has set fees at 1.49% per trade, with a minimum of €1 per trade. The bank will not charge custody fees, a detail that could appeal to retail investors wary of hidden costs.\n\nIn addition to the initial five tokens, Openbank will add more digital assets in the coming months. The bank will also introduce “crypto-to-crypto conversions,” so customers can move between digital assets without cashing out.\n\nThe launch is part of Santander’s broader blockchain and digital assets strategy. Openbank already serves more than two million clients across Spain, Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands, the U.S., and Mexico, making it one of Europe’s largest digital banks.\n\nSantander has dabbled in digital assets and blockchain before. Recently, it has been reported to be considering entering the stablecoin market, potentially issuing tokens pegged to the euro or U.S. dollar.\n\nThis is the latest move from Santander to experiment with new financial technologies while having the safety net of regulatory compliance.\n\nSantander’s move comes as other major European banks are preparing their own digital asset services. Germany is seeing a lot of momentum.\n\nDZ Bank, the country’s second-largest bank, launched a digital asset pilot with 700 cooperative banks in 2024. Deutsche Bank announced earlier this year that it would roll out a custody service for digital assets in 2026 with fintechs Bitpanda and Taurus.\n\nMeanwhile, Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe, a network of savings banks serving almost 50 million Germans, will introduce bitcoin trading through its Sparkasse app by mid-2026.\n\n_**Related: [Germany’s Largest Banking Group Sparkassen to Launch Bitcoin Trading](https://bitcoinnews.com/adoption/germany-sparkassen-bitcoin-trading/)**_\n\nElsewhere in Europe, BBVA, the global financial group headquartered in Spain, already offers digital asset services to clients in Switzerland and Turkey, and will roll out retail bitcoin trading in Spain once it gets regulatory approval.","sig":"3e042ac9db69a128078efb23132e3e5fe1f884a5823ec4917f357a6e964f9ee77545ac61a6442c86198b9afa106d2b670d511d93e53828dfd812dd8a4cb0c17e"}

At Blackstone, he saw oil and gas credit deals give way to ESG-driven renewables with poor returns, while 2020’s money printing highlighted fiat’s flaws. Bitcoin offered a scarce, durable alternative, and stranded natural gas provided the cheapest power to mine it. 360 Energy began by buying unattractive wells and converting gas into low-cost Bitcoin, later evolving into a service model for producers through infrastructure sales and rentals. Adoption is accelerating, especially in regions with strict flaring rules, and Sean believes major oil companies will integrate Bitcoin mining into drill programs within four years.\n\nBest Quotes\n-----------\n\n*   “We were spending all this brain damage, all this effort on structuring creative deals to make 10%, but someone could print money with the push of a button. Once you learn about Bitcoin’s 21 million, it changes everything.”\n*   “If you’re mining Bitcoin, your largest cost is electricity. How do you survive? Same as oil: the lowest-cost producer wins.”\n*   “These equity returns were zero until year 15. Even then, 6–7%. And that’s with tax incentives. Without them, they were negative.”\n*   “We bought unattractive wells cheap, eliminated pipeline costs, and monetized the gas with Bitcoin mining. Suddenly, break-even assets had real upside.”\n*   “In oil and gas, people thought fracking was crazy, until it worked. Bitcoin mining will spread the same way: one operator proves it, and everyone copies.”\n*   “If we could do AI computing in the oilfield, we would. But Bitcoin is the only workload that runs on Starlink, tolerates downtime, and scales in 1-megawatt chunks.”\n*   “The Bitcoin on our balance sheet gets almost zero credit from lenders. They say, ‘You don’t have much cash.’ But it’s the best collateral on earth.”\n*   “In Wyoming, a large producer shut in oil for over a year because they couldn’t flare gas. With our units, they can flow 200 barrels a day again. That’s the power of Bitcoin mining.”\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nSean’s story embodies the convergence of Wall Street, energy finance, and Bitcoin’s disruptive logic. Where Blackstone’s credit models hit diminishing returns amid fiat inflation and ESG fads, Bitcoin mining offered both higher economics and deeper alignment with physical energy systems. By reframing stranded gas as a competitive edge, 360 Energy is pioneering a new bridge between oilfields and digital money. The path forward lies in demonstrating reliability, building financing models, and expanding into flaring-constrained regions. If early momentum continues, Bitcoin mining could graduate from fringe solution to standard oilfield tool, and eventually reshape how drill programs themselves are planned.\n\nTimestamps\n----------\n\n0:00 - Investment Banking and Energy Finance Experience  \n4:30 - Deal Structure and Investment Focus at Blackstone  \n7:27 - COVID Impact and Shift to Renewables  \n9:51 - Bitcoin Discovery and Orange-Pilling Journey  \n13:18 - Connecting Energy Finance to Bitcoin's Value Proposition  \n17:20 - Partnership with Chris and 360 Energy Formation  \n21:29 - Renewable Energy Economics vs Bitcoin Mining  \n25:27 - Natural Gas Strategy and Asset Selection  \n29:14 - Low-Cost Producer Economics  \n32:12 - Asset Acquisition and Valuation Strategy  \n37:59 - Economic Modeling and Capital Requirements  \n42:22 - Volatility Comparison: Natural Gas vs Bitcoin  \n45:29 - Well Decline Curves and Mining Capacity Planning  \n50:28 - Transition to Service Business Model  \n55:54 - Industry Adoption and Bitcoin Perception  \n59:36 - Equipment Financing and Customer Decision Factors  \n1:07:23 - Industry Dynamics and Risk-Taking Culture  \n1:11:49 - Credit Facilities and Banking Relationships  \n1:18:58 - Strategic Focus and Geographic Expansion  \n1:21:48 - Future Industry Integration\n\nTranscript\n----------\n\n(00:05) Sean, welcome to the center of hash. Thank you. It's good to be here. Your former home, Bitcoin Park. I was going to say it's good to be back in the com or Bitcoin park. We miss you guys. We've only been away for a few weeks, but I know there's a a vacuum that we need to fill a void. Yep. How are things going at the new office? Oh, they're great.  \n(00:28) You know, it's uh it's sad to leave this space, but it's good to have our own space. We're growing the team a lot, so it's nice to have conference rooms to take calls and things like that. Signs of success. Yeah. Yeah, we hope so. You know, the team's grown a lot, putting deals out, so blown and going. Well, Chris, your co-founder and partner at 360 Energy, recorded in July.  \n(00:54) Um, and he and I were catching up and I suggested that we should get you on as well. You have a very different background from Chris and wanted to start out just talking about your the history in the oil and gas space on the finance side and how you came to be working on Bitcoin and specifically Bitcoin mining. You were formerly at Blackstone.  \n(01:18) So just talk a little bit about and then investment banking at credit Swiss for that both on the oil and gas side energy energy side I guess but yeah talk a little bit about your history what you were doing and how you ultimately decided to become interested in Bitcoin and then and then work on Bitcoin mining. Yeah definitely.  \n(01:42) So started at Credit Swiss in the oil and gas group in Houston, went to school in Dallas. Um, and that was like we talked about earlier, led ship for finance. You know, being an analyst in investment bank is a lot of grunt work. Um, but you do learn a lot over your two-year period there after what years was that? That was 16 to 18 in Houston.  \n(02:01) I've done my pledge ship in investment banking as well. New York 2006 to 2009 bank. So that was a pretty wild time and I know what it's like. Yeah. Yeah. Um so that was great but the goal is always to get to the buy side. Um so did two years there and then moved to GSO which was the credit arm of Blackstone. It's rebranded to Blackstone Credit now. Um in New York 25 person team across New York and Houston.  \n(02:28) Um and we were investing when I first joined in all oil and gas companies. So investing across the capital stack mostly preferred equity down to or up to senior secured debt. Um and you know day one it was all oil and gas. So, a lot of upstream deals, some mid-stream deals, a little bit of OFS, and it was just if you need capital as a business to, you know, expand your drilling program or buy more equipment, um, we would be a capital provider to help them do that and make return for our LPS. Um, so that was a great  \n(03:03) experience. You know, it's it's a very intense environment for sure. Uh, a lot of very smart people and I learned a ton. You know, I was there for six years overall. um learned a lot in my first three years.  \n(03:20) It's almost like the first two years are almost like investment banking all over again, but with a different skill set. You're just, you know, working very hard. Um long hours as well, but it's your LP's capital you're investing. So, the the standard is a bit higher on you have to be really sure you're right. Um at an investment bank, it's kind of you're being salesy, right? Um so, that was a great experience.  \n(03:47) Um so a question there one just total as an aside what does GSO stand for? Uh the three founders so Goodman uh Smith and Orover and that was a unit within Blackstone. Yeah. So those three guys were DJ credit squeeze guys back in the 90s. They started GSO early 2000s I believe um I think 2004 and then Blackstone bought GSO in 2008.  \n(04:14) So, and then specifically talk about the like in terms of the deals that you would work on, were you typically working on primary equity financings, credit financing all throughout the capital structure and just the nature of the type of deals that you would yeah have experience with. An example, it was mostly credit focused because GSO was a credit shop.  \n(04:36) Um, we would do minority common equity, but we wouldn't do control common equity. If there was anything controlled, that would go to the private equity group. So, Blackstone kind of has many business segments, right? Private equity, real estate, and then GSO was the credit arm.  \n(04:53) So, a typical deal, for example, um, uh, a midstream or sorry, an upstream operator in the Perian needed $100 million to go drill 10 more wells. We would give them a term loan, $100 million term loan, pretty expensive capital. You know, we targeted mid- teens and then we might co-invest 10 million of common equity alongside. And were these typically I mean presumably if they're getting a $100 million term loan, these are wellestablished companies are really often public companies, private mix. It was a mix. I would say most of the deals were private companies. We would  \n(05:24) do some public stuff. The biggest deal I worked on was a $1.6 $6 billion preferred equity investment into a system called Target Badlands. So Target is a massive mid-stream company publicly traded and they wanted to monetize a part of their Bacan assets, their midstream assets there.  \n(05:47) So we bought a 45% interest preferred interest um for 1.6 billion. You know, that's an example of a a deal we would do with some public guys in Bakans, North Dakota owns oil and gas. Yep. Oil and gas North Dakota. Um, so a gathering system means they have the pipes that actually connect to the wells.  \n(06:05) So they're the ones that build out to the pad, connect to the actual wells, and get those hydrocarbons to market, both oil and gas. And so you were there for six years. You mentioned the first two years being very similar to an investment banking first few years, but in terms of expos","sig":"905c1113f3ca03599d2274072eadb34ff2f71cff20718ad965ad8309faeb37ae5969481b4fc47033fef05ef866513be0d8377bb2d2b4c5af4c601c92aaa1aaa7"}

She believes the overreach awakened a critical mass that will resist future control schemes, but warns that rebuilding trust requires honest reckoning with suppressed findings and regulatory capture. The path forward, she says, is evidence over narrative, sequencing tumors, replicating analyses across independent labs, and protecting open debate, so public health can be grounded in truth rather than coercion.\n\nTimestamps\n----------\n\n0:00 - Introduction and hope for accountability with RFK Jr.  \n6:44 - Why this issue cannot be dropped  \n14:24 - Massive VAERS safety signals compared to historical data  \n19:43 - Suspicious lack of response to alarming data  \n24:26 - Jessica's journey from immunologist to vaccine researcher  \n29:02 - Hospital protocols and questioning medical motives  \n34:27 - Censorship of early COVID treatment discussions  \n39:02 - Pharmaceutical lobby coordination against RFK Jr.  \n44:53 - Liability protections and using children as shields  \n48:23 - Initial skepticism based on accelerated timeline  \n51:26 - Lipid nanoparticle technology and body distribution  \n59:08 - Manufacturing differences and DNA contamination  \n1:16:30 - Long-term generational effects and reproductive concerns  \n1:23:37 - Artificial intelligence as threat and potential solution\n\nTranscript\n----------\n\n(00:00) Many health agencies, including Health Canada, FDA, they're very well aware that this SP40 is in the shot files. They are completely undermining the potential danger associated with this. There are a lot of people who think this is all intentional and that they're trying to kill us.  \n(00:20) Even if you don't believe that, you have to admit that this is the greatest buggery of this scale of human beings ever. This was not about a virus, guys. This was about a system of control being imposed. When you don't tell the truth and when you're not transparent with data, you're pushing products to get them on the childhood schedule because you're free from liability and you make a billion dollars off that.  \n(00:38) Are you really concerned about my health? They were going to go fullon digital ID 15inut city type thing like you can't leave your area. Trump made the comment about operation warp speed and he was demanding data from fizer. This is huge. I anticipated that we were going to start seeing enormous numbers of people reporting Iverse events.  \n(00:56) The total number in the past 30 years of data collection in bears for all vaccines combined has been about 39,000 on average and in 2021 alone there were over a million reports. There was a big death signal in January at the end. In the past historically would have prompted the immediate withdrawal of the product from the market. I'm an academic. Peer review has been my thing. Now I know it's all a big joke.  \n(01:21) Yeah, you don't have to worry about uh the name of the spelling. We take it off and post. So, it's just our pictures and people will know. We're sitting down with Jessica Rose. You can see her name on on the video right now if you're watching on YouTube or somewhere else, but I'm sitting down with Jessica Rose, who I was introduced to by our good friend uh who's been on the show a couple times now at this point, Kevin McLaren.  \n(01:46) We've talked about the DNA contamination of the COVID vaccines and after last time we spoke, he was adamant that I have to reach out with you and get you on the show. A bit of a delay. He introduced us in March. We're sitting here in the beginning of September, but I think uh was a happy accident because there's a lot to talk about with everything going on. And so, yeah, it's a good delay.  \n(02:10) There's nothing wrong with it. that and that's why I reached out to you because I remember uh Kevin introduced me to Jessica to talk about this stuff and we have a lot going on on Capitol Hill. It seems like RFK Jr. is actually getting his way. We have a lot of people leaving the CDC.  \n(02:32) Uh we're finding out about uh the individuals who are at the CDC pushing the vaccine mandates during CO and I just wanted to get you on to get your perspective on what do you think's happening at that level right now? Do you think we're on the path toward some sort of unearthing of what actually happened and getting the the real data out to the people? I do. Um it's it's been wild to watch.  \n(02:59) I mean, you I don't know how long you've been watching all this stuff unfold, but I mean I've been I've been digging into the data uh the adverse event data for 5 years now. So, I I mean, it's been a horror show since January 2021, and I'll elaborate on that in a second, but um it's amazing that the feeling in the community of people I'm in, and it's a very broad international community of people from lawyers to doctors to teachers to vets, you know, like and podcasters, everyone in between. Um there's a real feeling of  \n(03:42) wow, you know, as in more than hope. It's actual surprise because and it's not that I think people are surprised that we're starting to see actual movement on the subject matter of vaccine safety. It's that it's almost hard to believe, if you know what I mean, because we've I I don't even think we as a community of people who are digging into this all the time and who dedicate our lives to the science know how bad it is, know how shielded the data is, know how many studies have actually been conduct conducted by pharma companies themselves  \n(04:25) that reveal like catastrophic adverse events that we we we don't have access to. We don't know about um this this hearing that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. uh as we all know is the new secretary of HHS recently uh I would say was subjected to was just I mean beyond revealing. Um the people the the small clips uh that I've that I've seen of the of the entire session which I haven't watched in full were so astounding.  \n(05:06) I mean there were so many um ad hominemum attacks. There were so many uh juvenile lash outs. It it's just not something I would expect to see from a room full of heavyhitting professionals. senators and doctors and you know what I mean? It's like I I would expect it to be more civilized.  \n(05:33) Um so it's not that it's not that I think it's a bad thing that that it happened that it's being revealed this way. I think it's actually very very telling um as to like why why are people getting so defensive on the subject matter? Because Robert hasn't changed his position. All he's trying to do is get scienceback data to actually um have the outcome of safe products on the market. That's all he's looking for. There's nothing to defend right there.  \n(06:05) He's looking out for kids. He's looking out for parents. He's looking out for American people in general. It's like, what is there to defend? So, the the reactions I saw from people just just at this hearing were were stunning. I mean, are they worried they're going to lose their their their handouts? Are they worried that um some weird personal truth is going to come out about them about what they've been defending and why? I mean, it it's it's bizarro world.  \n(06:39) Um but again, I I'll go back to what I started with. It's it's beyond hopeful. It's it's actual movement forward, I think. Um, and just one more thing about that, when when Trump uh you saw the post on X where Trump made the comment about Operation Warp Speed and he was demanding data from Fizer. Um, this is huge.  \n(07:05) um if he stands by that and if he actually follows through with demanding this data, uh ","sig":"e0eb43e7d6f437c8b660515052e3a4dc2a3fda98a4367e39d18366160e78ad04763c81139685c480e12b4640e4f8a16df9a1731c931be38f36d195e890849b43"}

Remove bottlenecks to getting more renewable energy onto the Grid Accelerating the green energy transition means we must overcome these four sub-challenges: reduce interconnection queues reduce wasted solar and wind energy and cut curtailment fees reduce the 8.1 year payback period for solar and wind generation facilities raise flexible energy generation demand 2. Replace Fossil fuel based heat with electrically based heat 3. Increase the speed and profitability of R&D into new renewable energy projects 4. Urgently end three carbon-intensive practices: Use of Gas Peaker Plants, methane venting and methane flaring This paper will examine, using existing case studies and research, how Bitcoin mining could be an important catalysts for climate action in each of these four categories. Background: why the narrative on Bitcoin and the environment changed? From 2018-2022, most of the narrative on Bitcoin mining focused on negative environmental impacts. These commentaries focused on issues such as excessive emissions, water use and e-waste “per transaction”. This narrative started to shift in late 2022, and by 2024 had been replaced with a narrative that focused mainly on positive environmental externalities. There was no single factor that caused this shift. The changes were due to a combination of Better data. Earlier data relied heavily on the work of Alex de Vries. In 2023 however Sai and Vranken found significant flaws in his methodologies concerning how he measured eWaste, water consumption, energy consumption and emissions. Cambridge recently reinforced this, finding that de Vries’ eWaste estimation was overestimated by more than 1000%. Other studies such as Lei et al found fundamental flaws in his use of Bitcoin resource consumption “per transaction” (Bitcoin does not in fact consume energy or water per transaction). The greening of the Bitcoin mining network itself. In 2018-2021, Bitcoin mining did indeed use a higher fossil fuel consumption than other sectors such as the banking sector. However more recent studies show that Bitcoin mining now uses predominantly sustainably sourced power As the research community has better understood the nascent technology, more nuanced and complete studies on Bitcoin mining in academic circles has emerged. 14 of the last 16 papers on Bitcoin and energy now support the thesis that numerous positive environmental impacts arise from Bitcoin mining. Media outlets then shifted their reporting to reflect the new data. Today, the majority of sustainability magazines who cover Bitcoin mining highlight its benefits, while 85.7% of mainstream news coverage on Bitcoin mining and energy since 2023 has also been positive. This shift is covered at length in our earlier piece “Is Bitcoin good or bad for the environment?” which we would recommend that readers who are unfamiliar with the changing view in the academic community and among energy commentators read first. To date, despite the improved studies on Bitcoin mining, they have tended to appear only in academic journals which may be inaccessible to the general public or those not familiar with the idiosyncracies of how grid infrastructure or methane mitigation works. Specifically, there not yet been an evidence-based article that attempts to objectively synthesize the different ways Bitcoin supports, or could in the future support, climate action. This article makes a first humble attempt to do so, using a combination of peer reviewed research sources, case studies and Whitepapers, to come up with an overall perspective on how Bitcoin is, and could in the future, promote Climate Action. 1. Remove bottlenecks to getting more renewable energy onto the Grid Why resolving these four challenges is critical Interconnection Queues Lengthy interconnection queues delay renewable projects from connecting to the grid. Reasons for delay include old transmission infrastructure, regulatory bottlenecks, limited grid capacity, lack of financing for the renewable project, and concern from the grid operator about the impact on the grid of more intermittent power sources. These delays can be as long as 10-15 years, slowing the renewable transition, and compromising our net zero emission goals. Wasted Renewable Energy and Curtailment Intermittent renewable generation often exceeds grid demand, forcing renewable operators to curtail excess energy. Curtailment can have far-reaching consequences, impacting not only the financial viability of renewable projects but also grid stability. It also hurts economically, with added costs often being handed on to consumers, because the grid operator must often pay the renewable generator a fee for not being able to take their energy. Australia for example is currently wasting 25% of all renewable energy. Such waste not only hurts economically, it slows down the renewable transition both directly and indirectly: directly by reducing the profitability and therefore the expansion-speed of renewable operators, and indirectly by giving fuel to opponents of renewable energy to question the viability of the renewable transition itself. Create more demand-side flexibility Variable Renewable Energy such as solar and wind generation require electrical grids to balance variable supply with adaptable demand. Lack of flexible demand (industries that can adjust usage) or demand response programs results in grid instability, making it harder to justify expanding renewables without risking grid reliability. Flexible consumers provide grid operators with the confidence to be able to increase the amount of variable renewable energy generation on a grid, knowing they have a demand-side shock-absorber in place. Long Payback Periods for Solar/Wind Facilities High upfront costs and slow returns (often 8–10+ years) limit cash flow for reinvestment. Extended payback periods deter investors and slow the scaling of renewable projects, delaying the transition from fossil fuels. How Bitcoin mining alleviates each renewable grid transition challenges By acting as a flexible, location-agnostic energy buyer, Bitcoin mining can reduce bottlenecks in renewable energy deployment, cut waste, and incentivize the construction of new renewable energy infrastructure. Let’s explore how Bitcoin mining achieves this through four key mechanisms: reducing interconnection queues, minimizing wasted energy, raising flexible energy demand, and shortening the payback period for renewable energy projects. 1.1 Reduce Renewable Energy Interconnection Queues One of the biggest challenges in deploying renewable energy is the lengthy interconnection queue process. In the U.S. alone, there are over 2,000 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy projects waiting to be connected to the grid, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. These projects often face delays of several years due to regulatory hurdles, grid capacity constraints, and the need for costly infrastructure upgrades. Bitcoin mining can help alleviate this bottleneck by providing a flexible customer for renewable energy projects. Unlike other electricity consumers, miners can set up operations near renewable energy sites, bypassing the need for grid interconnection altogether. This allows energy producers to start generating revenue immediately, rather than waiting years for approval. For example, in West Texas, Bitcoin miners have partnered with wind farms to monetize excess energy that would otherwise be stranded due to grid constraints. In Ethiopia, the Electric Power Agency has welcomed Bitcoin miners to buy excess energy from the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), in turn, powering growth and green energy and earning the country $55M in 10 months, which they are using to build out additional transmission capacity to deliver more renewable energy The scientific community agrees: by reducing the financial and logistical barriers to renewable energy deployment, Bitcoin mining accelerates the adoption of clean energy, a finding that is supported by You et al, 2023 (Mining to Mitigation: How Bitcoin Can Support Renewable Energy Development and Climate Action) and Menati et al, 2023 (High resolution modeling and analysis of cryptocurrency mining’s impact on power grids) 1.2 Reduce Wasted Solar and Wind Energy Waste and Cut Curtailment Fees Renewable energy sources like solar and wind are inherently intermittent, meaning they generate energy only when the sun shines or the wind blows. This intermittency often leads to overproduction during peak generation periods, forcing grid operators to curtail (waste) excess energy. In 2020, California curtailed over 1.5 million megawatt-hours (MWh) of solar and wind energy—enough to power 150,000 homes for a year. This wasted energy represents lost revenue for renewable energy producers and undermines the economic viability of clean energy projects. In Texas, there have been many cases of underutilized solar or wind farms. For example In 2022 Compute North (Now US Bitcoin Corp) purchased a 280 wind farm in West Texas. The farm had been known for high curtailment fees rates when wind was produced that could not be utilized by the grid due to weak demand. By providing a guaranteed customer for that surplus wind energy, the Bitcoin facility reduced waste, ended curtailment fees, and helped stabilize the grid. Also on the ERCOT grid, when Bitcoin mining company Jiachi West began operating in Texas, they reported that renewable energy curtailment dropped by 4%, and renewable energy profitability increased by 12%. By monetizing curtailed energy, Bitcoin mining not only reduces waste but also improves the financial sustainability of renewable energy projects. 1.3 Slash the Payback Period for Solar and Wind Generation Facilities The high upfront costs of renewable energy projects often result in long payback periods, discouraging investment. According to a recent peer-reviewed study, the average payback period for solar and wind facilities is 8.1 years. However, Bitcoin mining can reduce this payback period to 3.5 years by providing a reliable and lucrative revenue stream for energy producers. But these are not just academic theoretical possibilities. Indeed academia has lagged behind a large volume of real-world projects that have already integrated Bitcoin mining with renewable energy in order to increase the payback time. For example, Deutsche Telecom, Germany’s largest telco has begun using Bitcoin mining to monetize its otherwise wasted wind and solar power. It hopes to use the increased revenue to make solar and wind production more profitable, and reinvest the profits into more renewable generation. Tepco, Japan’s largest Utility company also recently announced a project to begin using Bitcoin mining on its wasted renewable energy. It’s goal is to further reduce waste of renewable electricity by using Bitcoin mining’s time-of-day agnostic properties to use solar/wind that otherwise would have been curtailed. 1.4 Create More Demand Side Flexibility Saul Griffiths, a leading energy expert and author of Electrify: An Optimist’s Playbook for Our Clean Energy Future, argues that flexible energy demand is essential for incentivizing the construction of new renewable energy infrastructure. Unlike traditional industries, which require a constant and predictable energy supply, Bitcoin mining is highly flexible. Miners can scale their operations up or down in response to energy availability, making them ideal partners for renewable energy producers. This flexibility creates a symbiotic relationship between Bitcoin miners and renewable energy developers. For example, during periods of low energy demand (e.g., sunny afternoons or windy nights), miners can ramp up operations, providing a steady revenue stream for energy producers. Conversely, during peak demand periods, miners can power down, freeing up energy for the grid. This dynamic helps stabilize the grid and encourages the development of more renewable energy capacity. In places like Norway, where hydropower dominates the energy mix, Bitcoin miners have become key players in balancing supply and demand, ensuring that renewable energy remains profitable and scalable. By improving the economics of renewable energy projects, Bitcoin mining helps unlock the capital needed to build more solar, wind, and hydropower facilities. These real-world examples highlight how Bitcoin mining is not just a consumer of energy but a strategic partner in the global transition to a sustainable energy future. Brad Jones, former CEO of ERCOT Texas’ grid, used Bitcoin mining to stabilize the grid after winter storm Uri, saying that Bitcoin mining ‘Helps us get more renewables onto the grid” but also “helps us counterbalance the intermittency of renewables” 1.5 Summary Bitcoin mining accelerates the green energy transition by helping both grid operators and renewable generators to overcome four challenges reduce interconnection queues reduce wasted solar and wind energy and cut curtailment fees reduce the 8.1-year payback period for solar and wind generation facilities raise flexible energy generation demand While it is by no means the only technology required to solve the first two challenges, there is equally strong evidence that it is the most profitable way to reduce both solar/wind payback periods and increase the flexibility of energy consumption. Additionally, it should be noted that sustainably-powered Bitcoin mining companies are not an anomaly, but rather they are an increasing norm. Currently there are 70 sustainably powered Bitcoin mining companies. 41 of these companies use 98%+ zero-emission power sources, and a further 29 using carbon-negative sources. Collectively these mining companies have helped make Bitcoin the world’s most sustainably powered global industry (52.4% as of April 2025). Like eVs, Bitcoin is a fully electrified technology with no direct emissions. Also like eVs, Bitcoin produces secondary emissions because a portion of the power used comes from fossil fuel sources. Also like eVs it is important to remember that this power obviates a more emission-intensive predecessor: petrol and diesel transport in the case of eVs; banking services and the extractive and fossil-fuel dependent gold industry in the case of Bitcoin. 2. Replace Fossil fuel based heat with electrically based Heat Why it matters According to the IEA, 50% of all the world’s energy is used for heating. Most of that heat is fossil fuel based. In parallel to greening the grid, prominent environmental campaigners and energy experts such as Saul Griffiths in his book Electrify state that we must also electrify as many industrial processes as possible, with heating being the single largest candidate for rapid electrification. While Bitcoin mining cannot replace the intense heat of a coal furnace, there are significant amounts of other heat forms that the exhaust heat of Bitcoin miners can replace and is now replacing. The potential uses for heat from Bitcoin mining are significant and growing. Some of these are one-off applications, whereas others such as delivering district heating to 2% of Finland’s population are already operating at a significant scale. The first reported example of a commercial operation using heat recycling from Bitcoin mining was Heatmine which started using Bitcoin heat for home heating in Canada in 2018. Since then, the use of heat recycling from Bitcoin mining has rapidly expanded. Since then, the applications of heat recycling have grown significantly. Cambridge University for example recently reported that “by redirecting this heat for applications such as district heating, greenhouse cultivation, or pool heating,miners can transform a byproduct into a resource. Meanwhile the International District Energy Association in their Q3, 2025 report stated “Electrifying heat production, especially in regions with low-carbon or renewable electricity, offers one of the most direct and effective ways to reduce emissions from district heating. Using the heat generated from bitcoin mining could significantly advance this electrification, transforming digital energy infrastructure into a source of high-temperature, low-carbon heat.” source 2.1 Evidence that heat-recycling is now occuring at scale District heating and water heating: MARA is now warming a town of ~80,000 residents in Finland using heat generated from Bitcoin mining operations. This is possible through district heating which involves centrally heating water using Bitcoin mining-generated heat and distributing it through underground pipes to local buildings. Heating public swimming pools: Global News recently covered how Bitcoin mining recycled electrical heat could be used to heat a public swimming pool, while earning money for the community Residential space heating: Home heating has grown from a fledgling industry in 2021 to a competitive market in 2025 with multiple vendors offering options to heat homes using electric heaters that mine Bitcoin in parallel, including 21energy, Heatbit and D-Central. Drying Lumber requires huge amounts of energy at a constant rate, but not so high as to “cook” the wood, making it a perfect candidate for Bitcoin mining exhaust heating. This started at scale in Norway, and is now being investigated in other countries. Heating for Horticulture: Bitcoin Brabant, led by Bert de Groot, has been helping decarbonize the greenhouse industry in the Netherlands by using solar-powered Bitcoin mining to deliver heat for the greenhouses. This reduces the greenhouse industry’s reliance on natural gas. There are already many such greenhouses being heated by Bitcoin mining, and this use has the potential to scale to help industrial greenhouses wean themselves off the need for natural-gas based heating. Replacing gas heating of greenhouses is a common use of Bitcoin exhaust heat. Bitcoin Brabant is now scaling this up, using solar powered Bitcoin mining Fish farming: Meanwhile, in Germany, there’s the Green Bitcoin Farm which harvests solar energy and uses it to operate high-performance computers in the Bitcoin network. They then use the waste heat generated by the ASIC miners for drying medicinal herbs, indoor rearing of edible fish, and vertical farming. Using Bitcoin recycled heat to heat the water for fish farms is also a common use in China. 2.2 One-off applications with the potential to scale In 2023, Shelter Point Distillery in Campbell River, Canada, created the ‘world’s first sustainable digital tumbler‘ by attaching a Bitcoin miner to provide heat for the whiskey aging process. Genesis Digital Assets (GDA) launched a Bitcoin mining heat repurposing project in Norsjö, Sweden, using renewable hydro-energy. The recycled heat is used to reduce the costs of preventing snow-cleaning trucks from freezing in an area prone to harsh winters. Constellation Heating uses its Star Heater to repurpose heat to maintain pool temperatures, replacing more emission intensive techniques such as gas heating. A car and truck wash in Idaho replaced its fossil-fuel based gas heating system with a Bitcoin mining heating system, using a Fog Hashing B6 immersion tank and Bitcoin ASIC miners to generate heat. When this New York Bath House started using Bitcoin heat to heat its water, it drew attention to how common the practice of using Bitcoin mining to heat water is now becoming. 3. Lift speed and profitability of R&D into new renewable energy projects 3.1 OTEC Bitcoin mining has been responsible for reviving mothballed renewable energy technologies such as OTEC, that the Reagan administration stopped funding in the 1980s. Unlike Solar and Wind technologies which are intermittent, OTEC (Ocean Thermal Energy Technology) is able to deliver reliable baseload electricity. OTEC however suffered from a lack of funding, because it is very expensive to develop novel offshore energy generation capacity in the tropics which is grid-tethererd. In addition to the challenge that offshore wind faces in supplying power back to the grid, OTEC must also develop hurricane resistance. Nate Harmon: Hawaiian Oceanographer, Clean Energy Pioneer and CEO of OceanBit, which uses Bitcoin mining to catalyze OTEC R&D Bitcoin mining on sea barges removes these constraints by providing a consumer of OTEC energy in situ. This means that the next scale-up R&D effort for OTEC is suddenly economically viable, because the operation will not need the considerable cost of being grid-tethered and made hurricane-proof. While eventually the aim of OTEC is that it will deliver power back to the grid, Bitcoin mining is playing a critical role in catalyzing the economic viability of the scale-up phase of R&D that prior to Bitcoin mining had been mothballed since the 1980s. OceanBit, which is developing OTEC (Ocean Thermal Energy Technology) was recently profiled in Forbes Magazine. OTEC was mothballed in the 1980s for political rather than technological reasons. OceanBit aims to produce abundant baseload renewable energy. Bitcoin mining is according to CEO Nate Harnon what enabled them to dust the mothballs off OTEC and start working on making OTEC economically viable. 3.2 Renewable Microgrids Gridless Compute, a Nairobi-based startup, is tackling one of Africa’s most persistent challenges: bringing reliable, renewable energy to remote communities. Traditional microgrid projects often fail due to high upfront costs and lack of consistent demand. Gridless Compute’s innovation? Pairing solar and hydropower microgrids with Bitcoin mining to create a guaranteed, flexible energy buyer. Image Source: CNBC In this presentation, Erik Hersman, the founder of Gridless showcases how broken the energy model in Africa is, resulting in 600 Million African living without electricity, and demonstrated how Bitcoin mining is already starting to unlock untapped renewable energy resources to solve this issue. Gridless says it’s sites have already powered 8,000 homes that were without electricity: 1,200 houses in Zambia, 1,800 in Malawi and 5,000 in Kenya. Academic studies have long argued that demand flexibility is key to microgrid viability. Gridless proves this by using Bitcoin mining as a “digital battery,” monetizing surplus energy that would otherwise go unused. As CEO Erik Hersman notes, “Bitcoin mining turns stranded energy into economic lifelines.” With plans to deploy 20 microgrids across sub-Saharan Africa by 2025, Gridless is demonstrating how Bitcoin can democratize energy access while accelerating decarbonization. 3.3 Other climatetech endeavors As humans adapt to Climate Change, the challenge of getting enough drinking water to arid countries becomes an increasing challenge. There is no one solution to this challenge, but part of the solution is to improve the cost-effectiveness of desalination, which is very energy intensive. MARA, who have also pioneered Landfill Gas powered Bitcoin mining, home heating, flare-gas mitigation and wind-powered Bitcoin mining, has begun investing in improving desalination technology while concurrently using Bitcoin mining heat, rather than natural gas, to desalinate water. This results in more water desalination per dollar of energy spent. This innovation if scaled, has the potential to increase water abundance in arid countries. 4. End carbon-intensive environmental practices (Gas Peaker Plant utilization, methane venting and methane flaring) 4.1 Gas Peaker Plants Gas peaker plants, notorious for high emissions and idle-time inefficiencies, are being obviated in Texas thanks to Bitcoin mining’s demand flexibility. Following Winter Storm Uri in 2021, ERCOT CEO Brad Jones integrated Bitcoin miners into grid stability programs. By 2024, 3 GW of mining capacity participated in demand response. In a recent report from the Digital Assets Research Institute (DARI,) the data shows that Bitcoin mining has now become a critical part of Texas’ ability to scale up the concentration of renewable energy on the electrical grid to meet the needs of their population growth. The ability for Bitcoin miners to curtail usage at peak times was sown to have saved Texas taxpayers $18 Billion because ERCOT did not need to purchase highly polluting peaker plants. During extreme weather, miners power down within seconds, freeing electricity for critical needs. For instance, during the July 2023 heatwave, Texas miners curtailed 1.2 GW (equivalent to three peaker plants’ output). Peer-reviewed studies by Bruno et al. (2023) support Bitcoin mining’s ability to eliminate grid reliance on peaker plants. ERCOT’s success demonstrates that flexible load resources like Bitcoin mining are not just alternatives to peaker plants—they are superior, more cost-effective replacements that support a greater concentration of renewable energy on the grid. 4.2 Turning Landfill Methane into a Climate Asset Landfills account for 17% of global methane emissions, a gas 84x more potent than CO2. Traditional solutions, like flaring or building gas pipelines, are often impractical because very few commercial operations can co-locate next to a landfill, or prohibitively expensive due to the cost required to upgrade the grid to handle additional electricity upload. Bitcoin mining offers a breakthrough: mobile mining units can convert vented methane into electricity on-site, eliminating emissions and generating revenue. In 2023, Vespene launched its 1.6 MW landfill gas-powered Bitcoin mining operation in Marathon County, one of five Bitcoin mining companies to do so. The project will mitigate 20,000 tonnes of CO2e per year. A new study was released in 2024 demonstrating that using landfill gas (LFG) for Bitcoin mining is economically viable, sustainable, and environmentally beneficial. Meanwhile, NodalPower now conduct landfill gas powered Bitcoin mining on two separate sites. Bitcoin mining companies like NodalPower and Vespene Energy deploy modular data centers at landfills, using methane to power miners. Over the duration of a project, Municipalities earn millions in power which can be reinvested into community programs, while saving millions in flare maintenance costs. Meanwhile, the methane becomes a climate asset rather than a liability. There are currently five Bitcoin mining operations operating on landfills, who are turning trash into digital gold. It would only take 35 mid-sized venting landfills with Bitcoin-mining power-generation operations on them to take the entire Bitcoin network carbon-negative. 4.3 Ending Oilfield Flaring Gas flaring, which wastes energy while emitting the climate super-warmer methane, persists globally despite World Bank efforts to stop almost all flaring by 2030. To date we have found few ways to make good that intention, with flaring in regions including the Middle East having recently been shown to cause more toxic gases than previously feared. Bitcoin mining is increasingly recognized in independent reports to be a potential scalable solution to this problem. Cambridge’s April 2025 Bitcoin Mining Report for example called Bitcoin mining a “Potential Solution to Gas Flaring” that shows the “potential for innovation to simultaneously address environmental challenges”, estimating that Bitcoin mining was mitigating 2.2 MT of CO2e emissions per year. In North Dakota for example, Crusoe’s projects reduced flaring by 99% at partnered sites. Similarly, Upstream Data’s Canadian operations have been cutting flaring since 2017. In another example, climate tech company Unblock Global has achieved 15MW of flare gas powered bitcoin mining in Argentina. The company has a mission to eliminate flaring in Latin America and raised $15 million to use flared gas from Argentina’s Vaca Muerta, to power its operations. These are three of the 29 Bitcoin mining companies that have found a way to solve the 160-year old problem of wasted flare gas. It is for this reason that the World Economic Forum recently praised Crusoe’s Bitcoin mining operation for helping the UN in its efforts to reduce methane emissions. Yet NGOs like Sierra Club continue to reflexively dismiss measurable progress such as this as “greenwashing”, saying that any company partnering with Oil&Gas to reduce flaring is “perpetuating the profits of oil companies.” As our earlier article on Gas Flaring highlights, this argument is not only flawed, but it has arguably led to the elongation of the practice of gas flaring. Without Bitcoin mining, the alternative is continued flaring. However, by monetizing waste gas, Bitcoin mining uniquely aligns economic incentives with environmental progress. 4.4 Summary: How Bitcoin Mining helps cut methane emissions and end environmentally harmful gas dependencies These Bitcoin mining projects are neither one-offs, not small. There are 29 Bitcoin mining companies who are carbon negative that we know of (using methane emissions as their fuel source), and 3 GW of gas peaker plants (that we know of) that have been obviated as a direct result of Bitcoin mining. The combined impact of carbon-negative Bitcoin mining is that mitigation has already reached 7% of the Bitcoin network’s emissions. As mentioned above, according to the Digital Assets Research Institute, and another 35 mid-sized venting landfills is all it will take for the entire Bitcoin network to become carbon negative. Remarkable, Bitcoin mining has in the last three years demonstrated an ability to profitably and scaleably tackle all three of these thorny environmental challenges where other technologies have proven either unprofitable, unscalable or both. Remarkable, Bitcoin mining has in the last three years demonstrated an ability to profitably and scaleably tackle all three of these thorny environmental challenges where other technologies have proven either unprofitable, unscalable or both. 5. Preserving nature Monetizing wasted renewable energy not only accelerates the energy transition but also helps save nature. For example, in East Congo, lies Virunga National Park, a 7,800 Km2 terrain that’s home to half of Africa’s terrestrial species. During COVID the park was threatened with closure, having lost most of its income, and having no way to pay its staff that protected the park from poachers, and militias who cut down trees to use as charcoal for fuel due to energy shortages in the region. Park Director Emanuel de Mode stated that Virunga “would have gone bust as a national park if not for Bitcoin mining.” The jobs created through the Bitcoin mining operation also provide an alternative income for the militias currently burning down rainforest to sell charcoal. Also, within Virunga National Park lies a chocolate factory that the exhaust heat from Bitcoin mining is providing the drying for, reducing costs and helping to pay those who work there a living wage. This is not a one-off example. In Costa Rica, Bitcoin mining prevented the loss of a 60Ha of land which had been in Eduardo Kopper’s family for 5 generations, and financed its transformation into an eco-sanctuary. The model used was identical to Virunga: utilize the otherwise stranded and wasted surplus hydropower to do Bitcoin mining onsite, and reinvest that into saving the land. Critics often assume, without research, “they could have done something else with that stranded energy”. Such a view is not only naive, it also diminishes the environmental contributions of stewards of the land such as de Mode in Virunga Kenya, and Kopper in Poaz Costa Rica, neither of whom were Bitcoiners, and both who spent years researching what to do with that stranded energy before realizing that Bitcoin mining was their one available option due to its unique location-agnostic, time-of-day agnostic features. 6. The unintended consequence of uninformed criticism While in some cases Bitcoin mining companies have looked for opportunities that enhance nature, it is equally true that sometimes they have neglected it. Before late-2021, a lot of Bitcoin mining was coal-based, A Bitcoin mining operation stole considerable electricity from the grid, while another in Niagara Falls was fined for being being an excessively noisy neighbor. There have been other instances of such noise complaints also. Critics and journalists should expose genuine bad actors. When it comes to this reporting, three glaring problems stand out. Firstly, for every genuinely bad actor, there have been misreported reports of bad actors that weren’t. For example, Greenidge Generation was misreported both as opening a gas plant for Bitcoin mining, which caused toxic algal blooms in an adjacent lake (it didn’t, it opened to provide power back to the grid, and there was no elevated lake temperature). Other reports have falsely accused Bitcoin mining companies of raising Texas electricity prices, destabilizing the grid and using excessive water. These claims all turned out to be not only baseless or based on very poor data, but contradicted by studies which reveal Bitcoin mining in fact has stabilized the grid (see claim 21) and helped lower electricity prices (see claim 22) by reducing curtailment fees while raising grid operator revenues. An anti-Bitcoin reporting bias only antagonizes those in the Bitcoin mining industry towards reporters, and deflects the attention that should be given to genuinely bad actors. The second issue is that those reporting on one off examples where Bitcoin mining operations are alleged to have negatively impacted a community have tended to also take a subjective side-swipe at the entire industry. Time Magazine did this in their Feb 2024 coverage of a Bitcoin mining company’s noise levels. More recently, the Cooldown used this same recipe by adding to an otherwise accurate piece of reporting on the Thai Bitcoin operation a wholly inaccurate statement “Whether done legally or illegally, the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining cannot be understated.” The comment is an example of a side-swipe that ignores the scientific consensus. In this instance, the article cited a comprehensively debunked outlier study on Bitcoin mining to back up the statement. Again, such statements antagonize the industry against the reporting organization, rather than keeping the focus on what may be a genuine issue worthy of examination. But the third issue is the most severe, because it doesn’t just hurt Bitcoin mining but the wider climate movement. Criticism, particularly from Environmental NGOs, without understanding of Bitcoin’s ability to end gas peaker plant reliance and substantially reduce flaring has directly contributed to the elongation of both the need for gas peaker plants, and the practice of natural gas flaring. (See linked studies for evidence of how NGO criticism of Bitcoin mining has backfired for the Climate movement). 7. The Carbon Payback Time of Climatetech It should not be trivialized that Bitcoin mining currently emits 46 Mt CO2-eq of emissions annually according to the Digital Assets Research Institute (up from the already significant 41 MT CO2e in 2021). The habit of some in the Bitcoin ecosystem of saying “But other industries omit much more” has earned the ire of some in the environmental movement and rightly so; every industry must take steps to reduce its environmental footprint. Equally, context matters: the photovoltaic (PV) industry, despite its critical role in decarbonizing energy systems, did not achieve a net-positive carbon balance until 2011—57 years after the first solar cell was invented in 1954. PV manufacturing continues to this day to rely on energy-intensive processes and coal furnaces to melt silicon during the manufacture process, however it is widely accepted that the photovoliatic industry is net emission producing, because it now reduces many times more emissions than it creates. All climatetech, including solar, has a carbon debt in the initial phase. Yet few recognize this when evaluating a nascent technology’s net environmental impact Similarly, Bitcoin’s emissions must be considered alongside its proven role in cutting methane (84x more potent than CO2), scaling renewables and other factors mentioned in this article. More importantly, like EVs, those emissions are not “additional”. By using the Bitcoin network, one is utilizing a fully electrified technology in preference to two substantially more emission intensive industries, The Banking system (as a method of transacting), and the Gold mining (as a store of value). The combination of much more careful research by critics and less trivializing of the real current-day emissions of Bitcoin mining will go a long way to ensuring Bitcoin mining realizes its full potential as a key tool of climate action. A balanced evaluation of Bitcoin mining, as with any emerging climate technology, requires assessing both its current footprint and its future potential. Just as early solar investments paved the way for today’s carbon-negative PV industry, Bitcoin mining’s ability to fund renewable infrastructure, eliminate methane emissions, and stabilize grids may ultimately yield net reductions far exceeding its operational emissions. Policymakers and environmental stakeholders must adopt this balanced lens, looking not only at current emissions but future potential. A good rule of thumb is this: if our rubric for evaluating a nascent technology’s climate impact would have resulted in solar panels being banned in the 1990s (when the photovoltaic industry created considerably more emissions than it abated), then it is likely to be a bad methodology. Conclusion: Bitcoin Mining is Tier 1 Climate Action Bitcoin mining has emerged as a linchpin for addressing four systemic barriers to climate progress, as demonstrated by both real-world data and case studies. First, Bitcoin mining directly tackles renewable energy bottlenecks. It does this by monetizing stranded power, miners reduced interconnection queues in Texas and Ethiopia, enabling wind farms like US Bitcoin Corp’s 280 MW Texas project, while cutting curtailment fees. Jaichi West for example found that just a 4% reduction of curtailment led to a 12% increase in profitability. Solar and wind payback periods, once 8.1 years, now fall to 3.5 years when paired with mining, which has led Germany’s largest Telco, Deutsche Telekom and Japan’s largest Utility, Tepco, to start utilizing Bitcoin mining for their previously wasted renewable energy. Second, Bitcoin mining replaces fossil-based heat at scale. MARA’s district heating system now warms 80,000 residents in Finland. Collectively, Bitcoin mining in Finland supplies district heat to 2% of the country’s population. Similar projects, from drying lumber in Norway to decarbonizing Dutch greenhouses (Bitcoin Brabant), prove that waste heat can displace gas-dependent processes. Third, Bitcoin mining accelerates R&D for neglected climatetech. OceanBit revived OTEC, a previously mothballed baseload renewable energy source, by using Bitcoin mining as a catalyst to bypass otherwise prohibitive R&D costs. Gridless Compute’s Kenya-based microgrids, powered by biomass and hydro paired with mining, electrified 8,000 homes across Africa and aim to deploy 20 grids by the end of 2025. Fourth, Bitcoin mining curtails methane emissions with measurable impact. Bitcoin mining collectively mitigates 3.2 million tons of CO2e annually, while Texas’ ERCOT saved taxpayers $18 billion by using 3 GW of mining demand flexibility to avoid building new fossil-fuel intensive gas peaker plants. Critics who dismiss these efforts as “greenwashing” overlook not only the sheer volume and scale at which Bitcoin mining is now measurably enabling climate action across multiple areas, but also the hard data: 61.5% of Bitcoin mining now uses >98% sustainable energy, and carbon-negative mining (29 companies) already offsets 7% of the network’s emissions. Projects like Virunga National Park—which credits Bitcoin mining for saving its 7,800 km² rainforest and funding anti-poaching and deforestation efforts—show that Bitcoin mining’s value extends beyond energy systems to biodiversity preservation. To policymakers and NGOs: the evidence is clear. Bitcoin mining is no longer a hypothetical solution—it is already resolving the grid instability issues at scale that accompany higher concentrations of solar/wind energy, electrifying parts of rural Africa, and funding OTEC breakthroughs. Rejecting Bitcoin mining’s contribution to climate action risks prolonging reliance on gas peakers, methane flaring, and methane venting. In the race to net-zero, Bitcoin mining is not optional—it’s operational. Let’s embrace it, research it, and leverage its unique ability to solve some of the toughest roadblocks en route to our Net Zero Emission goals. Footnote: Bitcoin achieves these climate outcomes while providing a number of equally numerous humanitarian benefits at an increasing scale.

These commentaries focused on issues such as excessive emissions, water use and e-waste “per transaction”. This narrative started to shift in late 2022, and by 2024 had been replaced with a narrative that focused mainly on positive environmental externalities.\n\nThere was no single factor that caused this shift. The changes were due to a combination of\n\n1.  Better data. Earlier data relied heavily on the work of Alex de Vries. In 2023 however [Sai and Vranken](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2096720923000441) found significant flaws in his methodologies concerning how he measured eWaste, water consumption, energy consumption and emissions. Cambridge recently reinforced this, finding that de Vries’ eWaste estimation was overestimated by more than 1000%. Other studies such as Lei et al found fundamental flaws in his use of Bitcoin resource consumption “per transaction” (Bitcoin does not in fact consume energy or water per transaction).\n2.  The [greening](https://forkast.news/bitcoin-minings-green-mile-54-5-sustainable-energy-use/) of the Bitcoin mining network itself. In 2018-2021, Bitcoin mining did indeed use a higher fossil fuel consumption than other sectors such as the banking sector. However more recent studies show that Bitcoin mining now uses predominantly sustainably sourced power\n3.  As the research community has better understood the nascent technology, more nuanced and complete studies on Bitcoin mining in academic circles has emerged. [14 of the last 16 papers](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielsbatten_from-mining-to-mitigation-how-bitcoin-can-activity-7280429495679963136-2E-q?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) on Bitcoin and energy now support the thesis that numerous positive environmental impacts arise from Bitcoin mining.

Remove bottlenecks to getting more renewable energy onto the Grid\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Why resolving these four challenges is critical\n\n**Interconnection Queues** Lengthy interconnection queues delay renewable projects from connecting to the grid. Reasons for delay include old transmission infrastructure, regulatory bottlenecks, limited grid capacity, lack of financing for the renewable project, and concern from the grid operator about the impact on the grid of more intermittent power sources. These delays can be [as long as 10-15 years](https://ratedpower.com/blog/UK-interconnection-delays/), slowing the renewable transition, and compromising our net zero emission goals.\n\n**Wasted Renewable Energy and Curtailment** Intermittent renewable generation often exceeds grid demand, forcing renewable operators to curtail excess energy. Curtailment can have [far-reaching consequences](https://www.pfnexus.com/blog/what-is-curtailment), impacting not only the financial viability of renewable projects but also grid stability. It also hurts economically, with added costs often [being handed on to consumers](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02497-0), because the grid operator must often [pay the renewable generator a fee](https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/lord/lord-ashcombe2/bill/2024-26/greatbritishenergy) for not being able to take their energy. Australia for example is currently [wasting 25%](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-08/renewable-energy-wasted-as-australia-greens/104321770) of all renewable energy. Such waste not only hurts economically, it slows down the renewable transition both directly and indirectly: directly by reducing the profitability and therefore the expansion-speed of renewable operators, and indirectly by giving fuel to [opponents of renewable energy](https://www.britannica.com/procon/alternative-energy-debate) to question the viability of the renewable transition itself.\n\n**Create more demand-side flexibility** Variable Renewable Energy such as solar and wind generation require electrical grids to balance variable supply with adaptable demand. Lack of flexible demand (industries that can adjust usage) or demand response programs results in grid instability, making it harder to justify expanding renewables without risking grid reliability. Flexible consumers provide grid operators with the confidence to be able to increase the amount of variable renewable energy generation on a grid, knowing they have a demand-side shock-absorber in place.\n\n**Long Payback Periods for Solar/Wind Facilities** High upfront costs and slow returns (often 8–10+ years) limit cash flow for reinvestment. Extended payback periods deter investors and slow the scaling of renewable projects, delaying the transition from fossil fuels.\n\n#### How Bitcoin mining alleviates each renewable grid transition challenges\n\nBy acting as a flexible, location-agnostic energy buyer, Bitcoin mining can reduce bottlenecks in renewable energy deployment, cut waste, and incentivize the construction of new renewable energy infrastructure.\n\nLet’s explore how Bitcoin mining achieves this through four key mechanisms: reducing interconnection queues, minimizing wasted energy, raising flexible energy demand, and shortening the payback period for renewable energy projects.\n\n### 1.1 Reduce Renewable Energy Interconnection Queues\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in deploying renewable energy is the lengthy interconnection queue process. In the U.S. alone, there are over 2,000 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy projects waiting to be connected to the grid, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. These projects often face delays of several years due to regulatory hurdles, grid capacity constraints, and the need for costly infrastructure upgrades.\n\nBitcoin mining can help alleviate this bottleneck by providing a flexible customer for renewable energy projects. Unlike other electricity consumers, miners can set up operations near renewable energy sites, bypassing the need for grid interconnection altogether. This allows energy producers to start generating revenue immediately, rather than waiting years for approval. For example, in West Texas, Bitcoin miners have partnered with wind farms to monetize excess energy that would otherwise be stranded due to grid constraints.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the Electric Power Agency has welcomed Bitcoin miners to buy excess energy from the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), in turn, powering growth and green energy and earning the country [$55M in 10 months](https://bitcoinke.io/2024/11/bitcoin-mining-revenue-in-ethiopia/), which they are using to build out additional transmission capacity to deliver more renewable energy\n\nThe scientific community agrees: by reducing the financial and logistical barriers to renewable energy deployment, Bitcoin mining accelerates the adoption of clean energy, a finding that is supported by [You et al](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c05445), 2023 _(Mining to Mitigation: How Bitcoin Can Support Renewable Energy Development and Climate Action)_ and [Menati et al](https://www.sciencedirect.","sig":"1ef9d22cf958d35b3b906364a74394ff6d4a9be5846914011f6984cc359ed16e3d816b3bc2198d21d8c595df22e4cec292273eb469e16fbbd9aa81e6aa16646b"}

By contrast, MicroStrategy bet on bitcoin’s scarcity and long-term appreciation as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement. From a strategic perspective, it positioned itself as a hybrid — part technology company, part bitcoin exchange-traded proxy.\n\nFor Bitcoin advocates, this approach showcases the asset’s evolution. What was once dismissed as a speculative token has now become the core of a listed company’s balance sheet, signaling a shift in how corporations think about reserves. But the risks are as real as the potential rewards: volatility cuts both ways, and unlike bonds or cash, bitcoin can lose significant value in a short timeframe.\n\n**MSTR Stock Under Pressure**\n-----------------------------\n\nDespite the size of its bitcoin holdings, **MSTR stock** has struggled in recent months. Since peaking in July, it has dropped nearly 28%, sliding toward the $330 level. Several factors contribute to this decline. Valuation extremes have raised concerns, repeated exclusions from the S&P 500 have limited demand, and investor fatigue around the Bitcoin narrative has weighed on sentiment.\n\nThis divergence highlights an important lesson: fundamentals and perception don’t always align. A balance sheet with more bitcoin than Apple or Tesla’s cash reserves does not guarantee share price stability.\n\n**The Amplified Beta to Bitcoin**\n---------------------------------\n\nOne of the defining traits of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin treasury is its beta greater than one relative to bitcoin. That means MSTR stock doesn’t just follow bitcoin’s moves — it magnifies them. When bitcoin rallies, MSTR surges. But when bitcoin corrects, MSTR falls harder.\n\nThis amplification creates both opportunity and risk for investors. For those bullish on bitcoin, MSTR can deliver outsized returns. But for those caught in a downturn, the drawdowns can be even steeper than holding bitcoin directly.\n\n**Options Market and Yield Compression**\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe options market adds another layer of complexity. Products built on MSTR’s volatility, such as covered call ETFs, have seen yields collapse as premiums declined. When volatility spikes, these strategies look extraordinary. But as the market stabilizes, the income stream falls, leaving investors with exposure but less compensation for the risk.\n\n**Detecting Regime Shifts**\n---------------------------\n\nFor professional investors, the key is not predicting the next headline but detecting regime shifts in real time. Systematic models that track market structure — such as probability-based regime detection — can help identify when MSTR is in a bullish run versus when momentum has turned.\n\nThis type of approach doesn’t eliminate risk, but it provides discipline in a stock where emotional trading can be dangerous.\n\n![image](https://lightning.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image.png \"Opportunity and Risk: MSTR stock vs. Market sentiment 1\")\n\n**Conclusion: MSTR is Not Bitcoin Custody**\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThe MicroStrategy Bitcoin treasury represents both a milestone and a warning. It highlights bitcoin’s growing legitimacy as a corporate reserve asset, but it also underlines the risks of concentrating an entire strategy in one volatile asset. For investors, MSTR is not just another equity — it’s a bitcoin treasury strategy packaged as a stock.\n\nAnd one final point is crucial: buying MSTR is not the same as holding bitcoin. Shareholders remain exposed to corporate risk, equity market sentiment, and balance-sheet decisions made by executives. True sovereignty in bitcoin still comes only through [self-custody](https://lightning.news/why-bitcoin-ownership-demands-self-custody/) — holding your own keys, outside the liabilities of companies or intermediaries.","sig":"7fa552126c53511bdd60bfd1a1150d368bfa3f1978554daa6c22961d21ff1e6e2f1401abb801d32580c2f513884c2d659aefc8f04efa611de4419f755597a6cc"}

Opposite it, the [CBDC](https://www.efrat.blog/t/cbdc) – such as the Digital Shekel or the Digital Euro – continues the fiat model: money that relies on trust in centralized institutions.\n\nIn practice, this means life under tight control, needing approval for every move, with no trace of privacy.\n\nStablecoins have become a popular bridge between the old and new worlds: a market cap of over $265 billion, daily usage of more than $100 billion, and projections to reach $2 trillion by 2028.\n\nThey are convenient, dollar-pegged, and save people in crisis economies. But they are centralized and dependent on private entities and regulators.\n\nIn fact, they are the digital arm of the dollar. The GENIUS Act in the U.S. defines them as national infrastructure assets: they must be fully backed, undergo monthly audits, and comply fully with AML/KYC. In other words – more oversight, less freedom.\n\nCBDCs take it a step further. They promise efficiency, but at a clear price: programmability, restrictions, control over expiration dates, where money can be used, and the ability to lock or freeze wallets.\n\nThis is money subject to compliance, not trust. In Israel, the Digital Shekel project is presented as innovative and cautious, but the public is excluded from the discussion.\n\nThere is no real debate about the risks, and the Bank of Israel along with the media usually present a one-sided picture.\n\nThis is dangerous: if today the law still guarantees rights, tomorrow a different government could tighten control – and with such a tool in its hands, the path to an authoritarian regime is short and dark.\n\nThe technological capabilities embedded in the Digital Shekel can be abused, even if they lie dormant at the launch stage – and that is precisely what makes it so dangerous.\n\n![Efrat Fenigson Blockchain Expert 2025](https://bitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Efrat-Fenigson-Blockchain-Expert-2025.jpg \"Bitcoin & CBDC: Economic Freedom in an Emerging Monetary System 5\")\n\n_Photo by Peleg Elkalay_\n\nParadoxically, this centralization and these threats will accelerate Bitcoin adoption, as it will be seen as the only real alternative to preserving economic freedom. The public will choose between convenience and freedom, and many will prefer cumbersome Bitcoin over an easy and supervised CBDC.\n\nBitcoin is a more complex creature. It is not just a means of payment or a [store of value](https://bitcoinnews.com/opinion/store-of-value-definition/) like gold. Bitcoin has the capacity to replace the global monetary system.\n\nUsing it requires more learning, responsibility, and discipline. But it is the only alternative that restores control of money to the individual. Against a reality of growing surveillance and centralization, Bitcoin offers a safety net that cannot be controlled.\n\nExperimenting with New Monetary Tools Worldwide\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nOn the CBDC front, the European bloc and India are following China, and Israel will likely follow Europe – which is preparing for the first step of launching the [Digital Euro](https://www.efrat.blog/p/european-central-bank-ecb-prepping) next month (October 2025) across the EU, in a stage that will last about two years.\n\nMost countries in the world are experimenting and will continue experimenting in the coming years with CBDC and stablecoin pilots.\n\nThe U.S. is leading the race on Bitcoin, through regulation and the implementation of stablecoins, while other countries like Pakistan, Taiwan, Bhutan, and even Russia – are experimenting with Bitcoin.\n\nIn recent years, I myself have visited cities, islands, and circular communities where Bitcoin is used as a means of payment and not only as an investment tool – places like [Madeira](https://bitcoinnews.com/adoption/bitcoin-atlantis-a-beacon-of-hope/) in Portugal, the city of Lugano in Switzerland, El Salvador, and more.\n\nThe change is happening, and will continue to happen, before my very eyes. The open question is – will we choose to lead or to be dragged along?\n\nConvenience Under Control or Freedom with Responsibility?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nYesterday’s panel only sharpened for me how much the questions of financial freedom, economic sovereignty, and personal responsibility are not academic.\n\nAs someone who has been following this field in recent years – as a journalist, researcher, and lecturer – I see how close these choices are, and how relevant they are to every one of us. We are in a race, and the choice – convenience or freedom – will be upon us sooner than we think.\n\nI said in the panel:\n\n> _“The state is not your friend. We are in a race to change the global monetary system. In the long run, Bitcoin will win; in the short run, stablecoins will help us get there; and CBDCs will teach people a lesson along the way.”_\n\n_This op-ed was originally published on [CryptoJungle website](https://www.cryptojungle.co.il/bitcoin-digital-shekel-freedom/)_","sig":"3525dd94343d88bcd51d21933cf540c0967fe91aca485525a49c57e410d737e9fae3b12319d6b8add72f733c100acc511d7aad0f464f43152fdd67d31d6b298b"}

Een hele samenleving mobiliseren is nog moeilijker. Toch lijkt politiek leiderschap een nieuwe methode te hebben gevonden: **wetten stemmen die vooral doelstellingen aankondigen, zonder duidelijkheid over de weg ernaartoe.**\n\nPolitici bepalen vaak het *wat*, maar weten zelden het *hoe*.\n\n## Voorbeelden uit Europa\n\nEen bekend voorbeeld is net zero 2050. De doelstelling om de Europese afhankelijkheid van fossiele import af te bouwen is legitiem en intussen wettelijk verankerd. Op basis daarvan volgde onder meer de [ETS2-wetgeving]( https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/carbon-markets/ets2-buildings-road-transport-and-additional-sectors_en) (mei 2023), die met ruime meerderheden in het Europees Parlement werd aangenomen.\n\nMaar wanneer de uitvoering dichterbij komt, blijkt het draagvlak fragiel. Volgens berichtgeving in de [Financial Times]( https://www.ft.com/content/8a2e2411-9e4b-41bb-9dc8-fb5eadfd0e67) twijfelen enkele lidstaten nu al of ze ETS2 wel willen invoeren. Vanaf 2027 dreigt die wet immers een zware belastingdruk op burgers en bedrijven te leggen. Ook het [verbod op fossiele wagens]( https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220603IPR32129/fit-for-55-meps-back-objective-of-zero-emissions-for-cars-and-vans-in-2035), in 2022 goedgekeurd, staat opnieuw ter discussie. \n\nTegelijk werkt het Europees Parlement aan een nieuwe [doelstelling 2040]( https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/climate-strategies-targets/2040-climate-target_en). Een ambitie die volgens de [Europese Commissie zelf]( https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:6c154426-c5a6-11ee-95d9-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_3&format=PDF) cumulatief tot 1% van het 2040 BNP kan kosten.\n\n![image]( https://yakihonne.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/def7bdbc8fc8823495398f04f0afc3fde18e7e35340a394cadd4aed78ce3f0c5/files/1757917558556-YAKIHONNES3.png)\n(in de grafiek hierboven is S1 het \"lineaire\" pad naar net zero 2050 - dus ongeveer 2 à 3% minder uitstoot per jaar - S3 is het versnelde pad voorstel van de Europese Commissie - 2040 doel van minus 90% t.o.v. 1990)\n\n## Rechtszekerheid op de helling\n\nWe hebben er belang bij vooruitgangsoptimist te zijn - en doomdenken is in deze context niet constructief. \n\nToch stelt zich de vraag of die aankondigingswetten standhouden. ETS2 weten we pas op 1 januari 2027. De 2040-doelstelling pas in… 2040. Intussen blijven burgers en bedrijven met onzekerheid zitten.\n\nInderdaad, rationele burgers en bedrijven moeten nu niet meer kijken naar wat de wet voorschrijft om hun investeringsbeslissingen te evalueren, maar zelf evalueren of de aankondigingswet stand houdt of inschatten in welke mate de aankondigingswet uitgesteld wordt. \n\nWie de aankondigingswet als definitief beschouwt, loopt het risico overbodige of te dure investeringen te doen. Wie afwacht, vertraagt de transitie. Zo ondermijnt politiek haar eigen geloofwaardigheid.\n\nWanneer wetten nog voor ze uitgevoerd worden alweer in vraag gesteld of uitgesteld worden, verliezen ze hun bindende kracht. Dat holt de rechtsstaat uit. En zonder stabiele rechtsstaat verzwakt ook de democratie.\n\n## Oorzaken\n\nDe oorzaken zijn veelzijdig:\n\n- het complexe proces van Europese besluitvorming - don’t let perfect be the enemy of good;\n- nationale partijen die te weinig verbonden zijn met wat in Brussel beslist wordt;\n- een pers die pas wakker schiet wanneer wetten tastbaar worden;\n- en politici die teveel vertrouwen hebben in de bureaucratie die Europa is geworden.\n\n## Naar een nieuwe aanpak\n\nWat we nodig hebben, is **wetgeving die niet alleen ambities uitspreekt, maar ook concreet maakt hoe ze haalbaar zijn**. Wetgeving die realistisch is, getoetst aan breed draagvlak en transparant in kosten en baten.\n\nDat vraagt om:\n- een politiek die opnieuw de regie neemt, in plaats van de bureaucratie;\n- verantwoordelijke politici, partijen en media die ook aandacht hebben voor abstracte, maar impactvolle dossiers;\n- en een samenleving die betrokken wordt, bijvoorbeeld via directe digitale democratie.\n\n## Ook overbodig\n\nAankondigingswetging is in veel gevallen ook gewoon overbodig: om ETS2 in te voeren is helemaal geen doelstellingswetgeving nodig - en ETS2 in combinatie met het verwijderen van de belastingen uit de elektriciteitsfactuur zorgt ervoor dat geen enkele burger of bedrijf nog fossiel zou willen verwarmen of rijden - het zou gewoon veel goedkoper zijn om te elektrificeren (als de belasting uit de elektriciteitsfactuur zou gehaald zijn).\n\n## Rechtszekerheid: een fundament van de democratie\n\nVooruitgang vereist optimisme, geen doemdenken. Maar vooruitgang vraagt ook stabiliteit. Als wetgeving een vrijblijvende aankondiging blijft, verdwijnt rechtszekerheid. En zonder rechtszekerheid verliest de democratie haar fundament.\n\nDaarom moeten we wetten maken die meer zijn dan intenties: ze moeten richting geven én zekerheid bieden. Alleen zo blijft politiek geloofwaardig.","sig":"55054995c8dc8b001adcae13ff4557c1ba2595f2cea9586e6c3856734d115eb7d781d1522088ab19eeb9f07073f9f37a099e2fcc6021359aad510137741a9e5d"}

Where were you and what makes that moment memorable?\n\n**CoinsBee:** _The moment we truly grasped the revolutionary potential of Bitcoin was more than a decade ago, when our co-founder, Marius, started to intensively study its underlying principles._\n\n_According to him, what immediately fascinated him, was the fundamental concept of a non-manipulable, absolute quantity._\n\n_In stark contrast to fiat money, whose supply can be increased at will by central banks, Bitcoin’s total supply is capped at 21 million units. This fundamental scarcity, which is governed by code and not by a central institution, was the key for us._\n\n**Bitcoin News:** What do you interpret to be Bitcoin’s core philosophy? How do you best embody this ethos on a regular basis?\n\n**CoinsBee:** _For us, Bitcoin’s core philosophy is freedom – freedom from centralized control, freedom to transact globally, and freedom to choose how to store value._\n\n_At [CoinsBee](https://x.com/coinsbee), we embody this every day by giving people practical ways to use Bitcoin._\n\n_Instead of keeping Bitcoin as an abstract investment, we let people buy gift cards, mobile top-ups, and services worldwide. That’s our way of turning philosophy into daily life._\n\n**Bitcoin News:** In your particular Bitcoin niche, how do you measure success? Which singular factor contributes most to achieving this metric?\n\n**CoinsBee:** _Success in our niche means adoption: real people using Bitcoin for real-world purchases. The single biggest factor is trust: users must trust that spending bitcoin through CoinsBee is fast, reliable, and secure. If we build that trust, adoption follows naturally._\n\n**Bitcoin News:** Where do you see the greatest potential for innovation within CoinsBee’s vertical?\n\n**CoinsBee:** _Our vision is simple but ambitious: to make bitcoin spendable anywhere, on anything – from Berlin to Kigali._\n\n_Today, CoinsBee already offers one of the largest crypto gift card catalogs in the world with over 5,000 brands, but we’re only getting started. The next step is depth: not just covering global giants, but bringing popular local brands everywhere into reach._\n\n_Even if you live in Rwanda or Timor-Leste, bitcoin should buy you what you need, from mobile top-ups to streaming subscriptions._\n\n_What excites me the most is the digitalization of services that were previously offline. Utilities, telecommunications, and other everyday essentials are moving into digital vouchers. Bitcoin is the natural money for this transition, and CoinsBee is building the bridge that connects it all._\n\n**Bitcoin News:** Would you consider yourself a Bitcoin maximalist? If yes, why? If no, why not?\n\n**CoinsBee:** I wouldn’t call myself a strict Bitcoin maximalist. Bitcoin is the foundation and the strongest signal in the crypto world, and I deeply respect its role.\n\nBut I’m also pragmatic—users want to spend not just bitcoin but also other coins. That’s why CoinsBee supports over 200 cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin leads the way, but inclusion helps the ecosystem grow.\n\n**Bitcoin News:** As a Bitcoin startup, what’s the largest challenge CoinsBee is currently facing? What’s the one thing that would solve/mitigate this?\n\n**CoinsBee:** _Bitcoin has always faced a challenge: people want to use it, but spending it has often felt clunky compared to fiat. Our mission is to erase that complexity. Spending bitcoin should be as easy as tapping your phone at a checkout terminal – and that’s exactly what we’re building._\n\n_We’re expanding our checkout experience so that wherever you live, you can pay with systems you already know and trust._\n\n_That means direct integrations with global exchanges, partnerships with local payment providers, and wallet checkouts so smooth that the whole process takes just a few seconds—or in some cases, fractions of a second._\n\n_By combining speed with trust, we can offer something no single wallet or exchange can deliver on its own: a global, frictionless Bitcoin shopping experience._\n\n**Bitcoin News:** How do you balance Bitcoin’s core ethos with the broader Web3/DeFi ecosystem?\n\n**CoinsBee:** _We balance Bitcoin’s ethos by staying true to its core values of freedom and [decentralization](https://bitcoinnews.com/adoption/decentralization-is-the-innovation/), while embracing innovations from Web3 and DeFi that add real utility. For us, it’s never about hype or chasing the latest token trend – it’s about practical integrations that make Bitcoin more usable._\n\n_That’s why we work closely with wallets, exchanges, and payment providers: to give people faster checkouts, local payment trust, and access to services that matter in their daily lives._\n\n_Bitcoin remains the foundation of what we do, but we’re not blind to complementary technologies that can help us deliver on Bitcoin’s promise._ _The goal is simple: make Bitcoin the easiest money to actually use, no matter where you live._\n\n**Bitcoin News:** Who are the most impactful Bitcoin relationships you have in the ecosystem and how do you maintain and nurture them over time?\n\n**CoinsBee:** _Some of the most impactful relationships are with wallet providers and exchanges who share our vision—partners like Binance Pay, KuCoin Pay, and Bitget Wallet._\n\n_We nurture them through transparency, long-term collaboration, and by always looking for win-win opportunities. Building trust in this industry comes down to keeping your word and delivering consistently._\n\n**Bitcoin News:** How has the recent collaboration with Bybit helped the company scale?\n\n**CoinsBee:** _Our collaboration with Bybit has been an important step. It gave Bybit’s global user base instant access to spend their bitcoin and crypto in everyday life._\n\n_Bybit Pay is the new payment system of Bybit and we worked quite a bit to integrate it as smoothly as possible in our checkout flow. For CoinsBee, it expanded our reach to new geographies and audiences, accelerating our growth in regions where Bybit is strong._\n\n**Bitcoin News:** What’s the most impactful product or service on CoinBees’ roadmap at the moment and why?\n\nCoinsBee: _The most impactful milestone on our roadmap is loyalty- rewarding people not just for holding bitcoin, but for actually using it. Too often, Bitcoin is treated as an asset to save. We want to flip the narrative by making everyday spending both rewarding and cost-effective._\n\n_That’s why we’re building a shopping experience that includes loyalty benefits, exclusive merchant discounts, and seamless entry points across categories (from e-commerce to digital services to mobile top-ups)._\n\n_The idea is simple: if Bitcoin is to become money for daily life, people need both the incentive and the ease to use it._\n\n_We see the next 3 years as pivotal. This is when Bitcoin moves from speculation into everyday money and our roadmap is designed to make that transition real._\n\n_CoinsBee will be the gateway that makes using Bitcoin practical, rewarding, and globally accessible._\n\n**Bitcoin News:** What advice would you give to a fresh Bitcoiner aiming to leave their mark on the ecosystem?\n\n**CoinsBee:** _Don’t get distracted by hype. Learn Bitcoin first. Understand why it exists and how it works. Then, if you want to contribute, focus on real utility._\n\n_Build something that makes Bitcoin more usable for everyday people, even in small ways. That’s where the real impact is._\n\n**Bitcoin News:** When Bitcoin has reached global adoption, how would you like your contribution to Bitcoin’s history to be remembered?\n\n**CoinsBee:** _Our co-founder, Marius, said he’d like Conisbee – and his contribution – to be remembered as part of the movement that made Bitcoin practical._\n\n_He added that if people looked back and said, “CoinsBee helped me spend Bitcoin in my daily life when few others did,” that would be enough for him._\n\n**Bitcoin News:** If you could go back in time and ask Satoshi just one question, what would it be?\n\n**CoinsBee:** _If I could ask [Satoshi](https://bitcoinnews.com/opinion/wisdom-of-bitcoin-creator/) one question, it would be: “Did you imagine Bitcoin being used more as digital gold, or as everyday money—and does it matter to you which path it takes?”_","sig":"034655efebde3561e986bb17f00eb009755647d7c92edd9fae563ebe070f67d57aef4ab9dea513d01a4b62ccf1ea7755714c666f8a4c56f49824cc012a6dd93d"}

Bob has a channel with Charlie. You can pay Charlie through your channel with Bob and Bob's channel with User C.\n\n*   As a result, it is not guaranteed that every lightning user can pay every other lightning user, they must have a route of interconnected channels between sender and receiver.\n\n**Lightning in Practice**\n\n*   Lightning has already found product market fit and usage as an interconnected payment protocol between large professional custodians.\n*   They are able to easily manage channels and liquidity between each other without trust using this interoperable protocol.\n*   Lightning payments between large custodians are fast and easy.

Bob has a channel with Charlie. You can pay Charlie through your channel with Bob and Bob's channel with User C.\n\n*   As a result, it is not guaranteed that every lightning user can pay every other lightning user, they must have a route of interconnected channels between sender and receiver.\n\n**Lightning in Practice**\n\n*   Lightning has already found product market fit and usage as an interconnected payment protocol between large professional custodians.\n*   They are able to easily manage channels and liquidity between each other without trust using this interoperable protocol.\n*   Lightning payments between large custodians are fast and easy. End users do not have to run their own node or manage their channels and liquidity. These payments rarely fail due to professional management of custodial nodes.\n*   The tradeoff is one inherent to custodians and other trusted third parties. Custodial wallets can steal funds and compromise user privacy.\n\n**Sovereign Lightning**\n\n*   Trusted third parties are [security holes](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/?ref=discreetlog.com).\n*   Users must run their own node and manage their own channels in order to use lightning without trusting a third party. This remains the single largest friction point for sovereign lightning usage: the mental burden of actively running a lightning node and associated liquidity management.\n*   Bitcoin development prioritizes node accessibility so cost to self host your own node is low but if a node is run at home or office, Tor or a VPN is recommended to mask your IP address: otherwise it is visible to the entire network and represents a privacy risk.\n*   This privacy risk is heightened due to the potential for certain governments to go after sovereign lightning users and compel them to shutdown their nodes. If their IP Address is exposed they are easier to target.\n*   Fortunately the tools to run and manage nodes continue to get easier but it is important to understand that this will always be a friction point when compared to custodial services.\n\n**The Potential Fracture of Lightning**\n\n*   Any lightning user can choose which users are allowed to open channels with them.\n*   One potential is that professional custodians only peer with other professional custodians.\n*   We already see nodes like those run by CashApp only have channels open with other regulated counterparties.

The U.S., meanwhile, is “fiscally boxed in,” overextended militarily, and deeply reliant on Chinese inputs, yet clings to ideology over pragmatism. Alexander likens the moment less to a Soviet-style Cold War and more to pre-WWI Britain, Germany missteps, where tariffs, posturing, and misreading the other side’s incentives raised the odds of conflict. He contends U.S. leverage still exists (consumer market, forward deployment, finance) but must be exercised through joint ventures, deregulation that enables on-shore production with Chinese capital/know-how, and, critically, an explicit diplomatic recognition of China as an equal to unlock cooperation.\n\nBest Quotes\n-----------\n\n*   “The United States is absolutely unquestionably fiscally boxed in.” – Alexander frames America’s limited room to maneuver economically.\n*   “China is a civilization pretending to be a nation state.” – Captures the core difference in how China views itself versus Western assumptions.\n*   “The moment the Chinese think they no longer need or find value in a partnership, they’re going to cut you off.” – On the transactional nature of Chinese business relationships.\n*   “Hope is not a strategy.

Their power comes from assimilation over time, not military conquest.” – Undermining the common fear of a Taiwan invasion.\n*   “The critiques of China are very narrowly defined and miss the enormity of what else is going on.” – Warning against reductionist narratives in the West.\n*   “The first step the US must take is to sit down and recognize our two countries are equals.” – On the diplomatic gesture China seeks most.\n*   “When you’re digging a hole and trying to get out, the first thing you need to do is stop digging. The United States needs to stop digging.” – His blunt prescription for US policy.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nAvoiding a needlessly dangerous confrontation requires replacing wishful thinking (“China will collapse”) with realism about interdependence and time horizons: China will keep chipping away at dollar centrality and shoring up resources, while the U.S. must “stop digging,” rebuild industry, and de-risk supply chains without theatrical saber-rattling. A face-saving reset, framed as equality plus practical pathways (targeted JVs, regulatory relief, shared standards), offers the best chance to stabilize relations, restore U.S. productive capacity, and keep competition bounded. Misperception at the margins is how great-power rivalries spiral; disciplined pragmatism is how this one doesn’t.\n\nTimestamps\n----------\n\n1:00 - Intro  \n1:05 - Peter's background  \n6:37 - China is a civilizaiton  \n11:17 - Western misperceptions  \n17:10 - Bitkey & Unchained  \n18:51 - Why this isn't Cold War 2.0  \n30:45 - Joint ventures and deregulation  \n34:25 - US leverage with China  \n38:43 - Obscura & SLNT  \n40:35 - Military parade, hegemony  \n49:54 - Opporunity Cost  \n50:39 - China's gold, Yuan vs Renminbi and Hong Kong  \n54:28 - Stockholm meetings and rare earths  \n1:02:11 - Recognizing China as an equal  \n1:25:08 - Taiwan  \n1:36:34 - Cautious optimism\n\nTranscript\n----------\n\n(00:00) The United States is absolutely unquestionably fiscally boxed in. If the United States didn't go to war for 20 years, would China be where it is? Probably not. If there was a significant reduction in access to the United States market, it would have a tremendous negative effect on the Chinese economy.  \n(00:18) It becomes this battle of attrition, who can suffer the pain the most? Above all else, it's about the resources. You started to see China begin to limit the amount of US treasuries it was going to take on. The moment the Chinese think that they no longer need or find value in this partnership, they're going to cut you off.  \n(00:34) The US right now is nowhere near having the ability to understand how to navigate it. I've been hearing China's economy is going to collapse for the last 25 years. Like what's the joke? China's trying to work at the margins to sort of undermine the American geopolitical position. This was as much if not more about national security and nobody talks about that. You need the Chinese to invest.  \n(00:54) The first step that would need to be taken by the United States, a sit down where the United States says, \"We recognize that our two countries are equals.\" \\[Applause\\] Peter, welcome to the show. Thank you for joining me. Marty, I got I got to do this. And this is going to demonstrate just how long I've been following you guys. the mandibles. The mandibles right now.  \n(01:27) Um I mean I'll leave that to Matt to to highlight and let him continue to beat you with a sock full of quarters every week because you haven't read it. But uh no, I was I was um I I just started laughing because I'm like, \"Oh, after we went back and forth last night, I thought to myself, oh, I'm gonna I'm gonna have to bum rush him at the beginning with the mandibles book.  \n(01:47) I don't have it on my bookshelf. I don't have it on my on my uh Kindle either. It's a book I I'll get to it. I think eventually I will get to The Mandibles. Okay. As I've said many times, a rabbit hole recap. It's essentially been read to me uh on air over the course of seven years from that. Yeah.  \n(02:09) And and to to answer your question, yeah, I I'm of the mind that we are in the middle of the mandibles right now. Lovely. Yeah. Lovely. Well, let's uh let's set the stage for this conversation. I wrote a newsletter earlier this week. We talked about um talked about it on Rabbit Hole Recap yesterday. There was a chart of China uh gold stock on Warrant at the Shanghai Gold Exchange.  \n(02:38) And if you see the chart, it is straight up and to the right. uh just a crazy step function growth over the course of the last year and a half really and that sent a signal to me like what's going on? Seems like China's preparing for something. Wrote the newsletter. You responded on Noster um saying that I need to get the full picture of China.  \n(03:01) You have been living in China for 30 years, correct? 30 years, correct? So maybe we maybe we start there. How did you end up in China? uh and uh deciding to stay for for 30 years. Um I'll give you the uh the abridged version. Uh number one, it's always great to be young and dumb. So I was working on Wall Street back in the middle early mid 90s.  \n(03:27) Um and that was the first time China sort of landed on uh the sort of Wall Street radar. And so I was dabbling in, you know, what was going on in China, you know, working as an analyst, so on and so forth. And ultimately I decided rather than to get my MBA, I was studying a little bit of Chinese in New York and thought, you know what, I'll go to China for a couple years.  \n(03:53) I'll teach English, get a lay of the land, firm up my uh uh my language capabilities, and then I'll just circle back and come to uh to New York and start up the whole new career. And you know, what's the old saying? You know, life is what happens when you're busy making plans. And you know, one thing after another just happened.  \n(04:12) Uh, you know, I did the the teaching gig and then I got a job working as an analyst for a UK investment bank in Hong Kong. That lasted about four months and then the Asian financial crisis hit. got married, had a couple kids, you know, became what's called a chief rep, which is a glorified sort of secretary for a handful of American companies, you know, did all that and then um right after WTO was working for Credential Financial of Lovely Newark, New Jersey and uh you know set up a joint venture for them in the finance space and thought you know maybe there's a maybe there's an opportunity here for me to become sort of a consultant. Rather than work for one company, I'll work for a bunch. So I  \n(04:53) went out and set up this company called Zeban Advisors in 2004 and you know it's sort of 20 21 years later I've been doing that just basically a consultant helping you know predominantly European American financial firms navigate what the possibilities are in China and it's not it's not that easy.  \n(05:13) Not simply because China is a different market, but because especially the American organizations, they're just so tied to how they do business globally and just an unwillingness to adapt to the local market. So, yeah, it's, you know, 30 years just happens overnight, you know, and here I am. Yeah.  \n(05:34) And as I was saying before we hit record, I'm very excited for this conversation. I've had uh Baji on the podcast. he's got um a perspective that China is going to eat the US's lunch if we don't really light a fire under our proverbial asses to to compete um in many different aspects of the economy. Uh I was also telling you that my interaction with the Chinese uh over the last seven years has been via the Bitcoin mining industry and from what I've observed these individuals are incredibly ruthlessly capitalistic uh in a way that surprised  \n(06:","sig":"a8b83569a822c9dd741b5d398915ab895cb2e22eb0c2479394c35df9a06f2a4cc84335d1511c5d0c61891dc8caeecdfa10443b24ad7719aff843b8c0f8263d07"}

Officials said the move was to stop anti-government content, but it backfired.\n\n![nepal protests ok boomer times up](https://bitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nepal-protests-ok-boomer-times-up.jpg \"Downloads of Jack Dorsey’s Bitchat Skyrocket in Nepal Amid Social Unrest 8\")\n\n_Protestors are mostly young people — [TheAtlantic](http://theatlantic.com/photography/archive/2025/09/photos-nepal-gen-z-protest/684168/)_\n\nInstead of calming the streets, it pushed more young Nepalis, into the streets [against](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/young-anti-corruption-protesters-oust-nepal-pm-oli-2025-09-09/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) what they saw as corruption, nepotism, and lack of opportunities. Within days, the protests escalated.\n\nGovernment buildings, including Nepal’s parliament and supreme court, were set on fire. Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli resigned on September 9 after facing public wrath.\n\nSecurity forces [responded](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/9/nepal-lifts-social-media-ban-after-19-killed-in-protests-report?utm_source=chatgpt.com) with force. At least 19 people were killed, with some reports citing numbers as high as 34. Hundreds more were injured as police used live ammunition and tear gas on the crowds.\n\n![nepal protests tens of thousands of people - bitchat](https://bitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nepal-protests-tens-of-thousands-of-people.jpg \"Downloads of Jack Dorsey’s Bitchat Skyrocket in Nepal Amid Social Unrest 9\")\n\n_The Nepal Police tries to control huge group of protestors — [TheAtlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/photography/archive/2025/09/photos-nepal-gen-z-protest/684168/)_\n\nIn the midst of the chaos, [Bitchat](http://bitchat.free) downloads went through the roof. The app, developed by Twitter and Block founder Jack Dorsey along with open-source developer Calle, does not require an internet connection.\n\nInstead, it uses Bluetooth mesh technology to send and receive messages. The app also relays messages through the Nostr protocol when an internet connection is present.\n\nBoth allow encrypted communication between devices.\n\nAccording to Calle, Nepal had less than 3,500 downloads before the protests. By September 8 it was almost 49,000. _“Today we’re seeing an even bigger spike from Nepal during youth protests over government corruption and a social media ban,”_ Calle wrote on X.\n\n> [](https://twitter.com/callebtc/status/1965721168507466097)\n\nNepal is now the largest user base of the app. For many young people, it was the only way to coordinate during the blackout. People reported the app spread like wildfire, with fast installations and friends or classmates passing it along to each other.\n\nBitchat was [launched](https://x.com/jack/status/1941989435962212728) in July as an experiment, but the unrest in Nepal turned it into a real-world protest tool. The app has no central servers, no accounts, and no need for phone numbers or email addresses. This makes it hard for authorities to monitor or shut down.\n\nAccording to the app’s [white paper](https://github.com/permissionlesstech/bitchat/blob/main/WHITEPAPER.md), no one can use cryptographic methods to prove that a specific user was the sender of a particular message. Messages are relayed across nearby devices, often within a 300-meter range, and remain encrypted during transit.\n\nThe app also has privacy features like “Panic Mode” which wipes all data with a simple triple tap — a nice option for protesters worried about surveillance or arrest.\n\nNepal is not the only country where Bitchat downloads spiked. Just a week earlier, protests in Indonesia over lawmakers’ pay increases also drove thousands to download the app.\n\nAbout 11,000 Indonesians downloaded Bitchat after concerns over censorship, surveillance and violent crackdowns.\n\nObservers see a bigger trend. As governments worldwide look for more control over digital communication, citizens are turning to so-called “freedom tech” — decentralized apps like Bitchat, Signal, Session and Status — to protect themselves.\n\nFor Dorsey and Calle, the protests in Nepal and Indonesia have shown Bitchat’s potential, but also what’s missing. Calle said the team is now working on adding Bitcoin-based payments through [Ecash](https://bitcoinnews.com/adoption/cashu-reclaiming-privacy-bitcoins-ally/), to make the app a platform not just for communication, but also for private financial transactions.","sig":"aa9d08eaa144c9b5155bd0426cd3577a6136e6bbf033757494c9672089a18afdcecceaca8e0e7b3d97a886d1e011a2c79df542c12840b58a6eeaa9e48adc34c0"}

Strive, Inc. (Nasdaq: ASST), an Executive Member of BFC, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Semler Scientific, Inc. (Nasdaq: SMLR), a Premier Member of BFC, in an all-stock transaction. The deal represents one of the first major consolidations between publicly traded Bitcoin treasury companies, signaling a new phase of maturity in this emerging asset class. For corporations, capital allocators, and market observers, this merger underscores how Bitcoin is no longer a peripheral balance sheet entry — it is becoming the foundation for strategic growth, capital structure innovation, and shareholder value creation. Deal Snapshot The transaction delivers a 210% premium to Semler Scientific shareholders, with each Semler share exchanged for 21.05 Strive Class A shares. Alongside the merger announcement, Strive revealed the purchase of 5,816 Bitcoin for $675 million, at an average price of $116,047 per Bitcoin, bringing its treasury to 5,886 Bitcoin. Upon closing, the combined company will control more than 10,900 Bitcoin, placing it firmly among the largest corporate holders globally. Leadership continuity is assured, with Strive’s management and Board of Directors remaining in place, and Semler’s Executive Chairman, Eric Semler, joining Strive’s board. Strategic Capital Innovation One of the most compelling aspects of this deal lies in Strive’s declared capital strategy. Unlike debt-driven accumulation models pioneered by Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), Strive intends to rely exclusively on perpetual preferred equity to finance Bitcoin purchases. This “preferred equity only” model is designed to eliminate the refinancing risks that accompany traditional debt maturities. By sidestepping the need to roll over debt in volatile markets, Strive is positioning itself as a more stable, long-term accumulator of Bitcoin. Comparisons highlight just how differentiated corporate Bitcoin strategies are becoming. Strategy has leaned heavily on convertible debt to build scale. Metaplanet in Japan has innovated with moving-strike warrants and retail participation structures. The Blockchain Group in Europe has relied on Bitcoin-denominated bonds. Strive’s model adds another tool to the playbook: equity instruments engineered to maximize Bitcoin per share while avoiding balance sheet fragility. The Membership Lens: BFC’s Network in Action That two BFC members are at the center of this landmark transaction speaks volumes about the momentum within our network. Strive, an Executive Member, has pioneered the concept of a publicly traded asset management company with Bitcoin as its treasury backbone. Its mandate has been explicit: outperform Bitcoin itself by growing Bitcoin per share through innovative financing. Semler Scientific, a Premier Member, was the second U.S. public company to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. By financing accumulation through both equity issuance and cash flows from a profitable healthcare business, Semler built a dual strategy blending treasury innovation with operating income. Together, these companies exemplify how members of the BFC ecosystem are not only adopting Bitcoin but also creating entirely new corporate archetypes in the process. Beyond Treasury: A Dual Mandate While the combined company will emerge as a scaled Bitcoin accumulator, Semler brings more than its treasury. Its diagnostics business has long been profitable, anchored by its FDA-cleared QuantaFlo system for detecting peripheral arterial disease. Post-merger, Strive intends to explore monetizing or distributing this diagnostics unit, freeing capital for redeployment or providing direct value to shareholders. The combined company also highlighted ambitions to expand into preventative diagnostics and wellness. The lesson for corporations is clear: pursuing a Bitcoin treasury strategy does not mean abandoning productive businesses. Instead, Bitcoin can serve as the anchor asset while operating units generate optionality — whether through spin-offs, monetization, or reinvestment. Market Context & Investor Signal The 210% premium offered to Semler shareholders is a powerful signal of investor appetite. It demonstrates that markets are willing to reward corporate balance sheets anchored in Bitcoin at levels far beyond traditional operating multiples. This premium sets a new benchmark for how Bitcoin treasury companies may be valued going forward. It also illustrates a new pathway for growth: mergers and acquisitions as a mechanism for rapidly scaling Bitcoin holdings, alongside equity offerings and preferred structures. Wall Street is beginning to recognize Bitcoin treasuries as not just novel strategies, but as capital engines capable of delivering outsized shareholder returns. Leadership & Governance The leadership continuity at Strive ensures strategic stability, while Eric Semler’s addition to the board strengthens the combined entity’s depth of experience. Strive brings its asset management expertise, while Semler contributes years of operating success and a record of being one of the earliest U.S. corporate adopters of Bitcoin. This merger creates a leadership team that spans both finance and healthcare, united by a common belief in Bitcoin as the foundation of corporate strategy. Implications for Corporate Treasuries For CFOs, boards, and executives evaluating Bitcoin strategies, several lessons emerge from this transaction: Scale matters: Controlling more than 10,900 Bitcoin gives the combined company strategic relevance on a global stage. Capital structure innovation is key: Preferred equity models can reduce risk while maintaining access to capital. Premiums are achievable: Markets are rewarding bold balance sheet strategies, as evidenced by the 210% uplift for Semler shareholders. Optionality creates resilience: Combining Bitcoin accumulation with operating businesses can offer shareholders both financial and strategic upside. This is not just about holding Bitcoin; it’s about engineering corporate structures to turn Bitcoin into a competitive advantage. Future Outlook: The Era of Consolidation The Strive–Semler deal marks the beginning of what could be a wave of consolidation in the Bitcoin treasury sector. As more public companies adopt Bitcoin strategies, mergers may become an increasingly attractive way to scale holdings quickly, reduce competition, and capture investor attention. The combined entity now sits among the top tier of corporate Bitcoin holders, alongside Strategy, Metaplanet, and The Blockchain Group. This competitive layer of Bitcoin-native companies is racing to accumulate, refine capital models, and prove to shareholders that Bitcoin per share growth is the ultimate measure of success. Conclusion: More Than a Merger This transaction is more than a headline. It is a marker of Bitcoin’s deepening role in global capital markets and corporate finance. Strive and Semler Scientific, both members of the BFC network, are showcasing how corporations can not only adopt Bitcoin but use it to reshape capital structures, investor relationships, and operating strategies. For corporate leaders watching closely, the lesson is clear: Bitcoin is no longer an experiment on the balance sheet. It is the foundation of bold corporate strategy, capable of driving shareholder premiums, fueling innovation, and setting new standards for value creation. As always, BFC will continue to track, analyze, and equip corporations with the tools and frameworks to navigate this accelerating landscape.

[Cynthia Lummis](https://bitcoinnews.com/adoption/cynthia-lummis-commends-bitcoin/) (R-WY), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH), Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Rep. Nick Begich (R-AK), Rep. Pat Harrigan (R-NC), House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), House Financial Services Chair French Hill (R-AR), and Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN).\n\nOn the industry side, participants included Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy and one of Bitcoin’s biggest champions, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel, and other execs from mining and digital asset companies.\n\nThe meetings were hosted by advocacy groups like the Digital Chamber, the [Digital Power Network](https://x.com/DigitalPowerUS/status/1968054179479613704), and the new Treasury Council.\n\n![strategic bitcoin reserve meetings](https://bitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/strategic-bitcoin-reserve-meetings.jpg \"US Lawmakers and Digital Asset Execs Meet to Push for Bitcoin Reserve 11\")\n\n_Political figures and well-known digital asset execs took part in the meetings_\n\nThe core proposal, outlined in the BITCOIN Act, would have the U.S. government build a strategic reserve of up to 1 million bitcoin, just like how gold has been held as a national reserve asset.\n\nSupporters say this would strengthen America’s financial position and ensure the country is a leader in the future of digital assets.\n\n_“Legislators and the executives at yesterday’s roundtable agree, there is a need \\[for\\] a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve law to ensure its longevity for America’s financial future,”_ said Hailey Miller, Director of Government Affairs at the Digital Power Network.\n\nThe bill, [reintroduced](https://bitcoinnews.com/adoption/the-bitcoin-act-is-back/) by Sen. Lummis in March, builds on an executive order signed by President Donald Trump which first established the concept of a bitcoin reserve and barred the government from selling bitcoin seized in criminal or civil cases.\n\nLummis’s bill goes further — not just holding seized coins, but also buying more.\n\nAccording to the proposal, the government could use “budget-neutral strategies” to fund the purchases, including revaluing gold certificates and earnings from Federal Reserve banks.\n\n_**Related: [US to Use Tariffs and Gold Revaluation to Build Bitcoin Reserves](https://bitcoinnews.com/adoption/tariffs-gold-strategic-bitcoin-reserves/)**_\n\nMichael Saylor, whose company is the largest public holder of bitcoin with over 638,000 BTC, has been leading the charge. At the roundtable, Saylor said Bitcoin is more than just an investment.\n\n_“Bitcoin represents economic freedom,”_ he said, urging the U.S. to adopt it as a reserve asset to maintain global financial leadership.\n\nSaylor also noted that Bitcoin is already changing the global financial system, and the U.S. must move fast if it wants to stay ahead.\n\n> [](https://twitter.com/BitcoinNewsCom/status/1968802188576063539)\n\nOther executives, including Thiel and Tom Lee of BitMine, agreed and joined the Treasury Council in sending a letter to Congress to pass the bill. The letter said a bitcoin reserve would “hedge against systemic risks” and keep America at the top of the financial world.\n\nThe roundtables also showed growing support within the Republican Party. Speaker Mike Johnson said House Republicans will work “hand in glove” with the industry.\n\n_“We’re in this together,”_ Johnson said at a Bitcoin Voter PAC event after meeting with digital asset execs and lawmakers.\n\n_“(Congress) relies upon the insight and expertise (of the members of the industry) to be able to have policy that allows for further growth and advancement of the industry.”_","sig":"e5b02d514e94056ccd5fccacefd94ca4dc8223802cf3d1d6f2b6136a737613446e9905a958e2fb7cec9843d7ca734ea2ad2e57c7af640550eb5b07c0479917b8"}

The move is a big step for one of Europe’s largest financial institutions into the digital asset space, with Spain to follow in the coming weeks.\n\nThe new service allows Openbank customers to buy, sell, and hold bitcoin, as well as four top altcoins — Ethereum, Litecoin, Polygon, and Cardano — directly on the bank’s investment platform.\n\nThe service sits alongside Openbank’s traditional investment products such as stocks, funds, ETFs, and robo-advisory services.\n\nBy trading within its own platform, Openbank eliminates the need for customers to transfer funds to third-party exchanges. The service is also under the European Union’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets ([MiCA](https://bitcoinnews.com/markets/new-eu-framework-mica-benefit-bitcoin/)) regulation, which provides legal clarity and investor protection across the bloc.\n\nCoty de Monteverde, Head of Crypto at Grupo Santander, said:\n\n> _“By incorporating the main cryptocurrencies into our investment platform, we are responding to the demand of some of our customers and continue to strengthen a broad range of products and services through an agile, simple technology platform backed by one of the world’s leading financial groups.”_\n\nOpenbank has set fees at 1.49% per trade, with a minimum of €1 per trade. The bank will not charge custody fees, a detail that could appeal to retail investors wary of hidden costs.\n\nIn addition to the initial five tokens, Openbank will add more digital assets in the coming months. The bank will also introduce “crypto-to-crypto conversions,” so customers can move between digital assets without cashing out.\n\nThe launch is part of Santander’s broader blockchain and digital assets strategy. Openbank already serves more than two million clients across Spain, Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands, the U.S., and Mexico, making it one of Europe’s largest digital banks.\n\nSantander has dabbled in digital assets and blockchain before. Recently, it has been reported to be considering entering the stablecoin market, potentially issuing tokens pegged to the euro or U.S. dollar.\n\nThis is the latest move from Santander to experiment with new financial technologies while having the safety net of regulatory compliance.\n\nSantander’s move comes as other major European banks are preparing their own digital asset services. Germany is seeing a lot of momentum.\n\nDZ Bank, the country’s second-largest bank, launched a digital asset pilot with 700 cooperative banks in 2024. Deutsche Bank announced earlier this year that it would roll out a custody service for digital assets in 2026 with fintechs Bitpanda and Taurus.\n\nMeanwhile, Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe, a network of savings banks serving almost 50 million Germans, will introduce bitcoin trading through its Sparkasse app by mid-2026.\n\n_**Related: [Germany’s Largest Banking Group Sparkassen to Launch Bitcoin Trading](https://bitcoinnews.com/adoption/germany-sparkassen-bitcoin-trading/)**_\n\nElsewhere in Europe, BBVA, the global financial group headquartered in Spain, already offers digital asset services to clients in Switzerland and Turkey, and will roll out retail bitcoin trading in Spain once it gets regulatory approval.","sig":"a861bd4e867b9b3f8554ea4061a19b3960b9ff8f87de0225ee22efd7d3cb8cff6e92d607aea8285be51ee8fae0fd4e513c1deeab2281562244753b057e2a2d85"}

In June, the **Moscow Metro** announced its first payment in digital rubles.

The operation saw the Russian Treasury pay a government official of the Russian Federation a salary in digital rubles for the first time.\n\nThe initiative to integrate the digital ruble into the national budget process is being conducted in collaboration with the **Central Bank of Russia (CBR)**, the authority responsible for issuing the digital currency. Starting **January 1, 2026**, the Ministry of Finance and the CBR will enable transactions between digital ruble accounts.\n\nThe digital version of the national currency will be used for **intra-budget transfers** and to make various payments from the federal budget.\n\nRussian media revealed the identity of the first salary recipient: **Anatoly Aksakov**, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, the lower House of the Russian Parliament.\n\nThe lawmaker received the funds in his digital wallet on the CBR’s dedicated platform and subsequently participated in tests by making several payments.\n\n### **Launch roadmap**\n\nThe Bank of Russia began developing its CBDC in 2021, with the Russian Parliament passing the necessary legislation two years later. The CBR started pilot programs involving a limited number of participants, including commercial banks, businesses, and private citizens.\n\nInitially planned for 2025, the launch of the Russian digital ruble was postponed to 2026. Following President **Vladimir Putin’s directives** for widespread adoption, the central bank set the official launch date for **September 1, 2026**.\n\n### **First use cases**\n\nSeveral sectors have already begun testing the digital ruble in real-world scenarios. In June, the **Moscow Metro** announced its first payment in digital rubles. In August, Russia recorded its first real estate transaction completed using the government CBDC.\n\nIn September, **St. Petersburg’s Pulkovo Airport**, the country’s second busiest, accepted digital ruble payments from a visitor who paid for parking by scanning a QR code with their smartphone.\n\nThe post [Russia issues first salary in digital ruble](https://atlas21.com/russia-issues-first-salary-in-digital-ruble/) appeared first on [Atlas21](https://atlas21.com).","sig":"45aab7ca184ffe65d33d0af888088ae3e51c0db12c3799ee0e3b7d4a54edd2825ea37e802e043192e6bde3b36e615abdf1051aded7e8b2a9501d4b268f389c92"}

The company still operates one of the largest self-run mining fleets in the U.S., and analysts point to the miner’s sizable bitcoin cash flow — roughly hundreds of millions in EBITDA at current prices — as a funding source for the AI capex. \n\nThat optionality — toggle between mining and GPU hosting depending on which yields more per megawatt — is central to investors’ willingness to assign a premium multiple to IREN’s new AI assets. [](https://www.theblock.co/post/372176/bernstein-raises-bitcoin-miner-iren-price-target-ai-cloud-scaling-all-time-high?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nThis post [IREN Stock Soars: Bitcoin Mining Firm Surges on Wall Street AI Cloud Optimism](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/bitcoin-mining/iren-stock-soars-bitcoin-mining-firm-surges-on-wall-street-ai-cloud-optimism) first appeared on [Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com) and is written by [Micah Zimmerman](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/micahzimmerman).","sig":"db13da412007bf0e40207d36433009ca3fe40f89ea074f70cec7fbc1858f0adf424855a53b9fae938130e93a545b1faa692b7476f9a80f60caaf77a5eb8fabf1"}

Lack of privacy leads to loss of autonomy. When individuals are constantly monitored it limits our ability to express ourselves and take risks. Any decisions we make can result in negative repercussions from those who surveil us. Without the freedom to make choices, individuals cannot truly be free.\n\n**Freedom is essential to acquiring and preserving wealth.** When individuals are not free to make choices, restrictions and limitations prevent us from economic opportunities. If we are somehow able to acquire wealth in such an environment, lack of freedom can result in direct asset seizure by governments or other malicious entities. At scale, when freedom is compromised, it leads to widespread economic stagnation and poverty. Protecting freedom is essential to economic prosperity.\n\nThe connection between **privacy, freedom, and wealth** is critical. Without privacy, individuals lose the freedom to make choices free from surveillance and control.

However, if someone can give you something, they can inherently take it from you at will. People throughout history have necessarily fought for basic rights, including privacy and freedom. These rights were not given by those in power, but rather demanded and won through struggle.

This creates a choke point for cartel behavior (e.g., fee manipulation, filtering Lightning), regulatory coercion (OFAC-style censorship), and smoother adoption of contentious changes, especially when relay-policy shifts can be de-facto standardized by a few pools. The hosts distinguish hashing vs. mining, relay policy vs. consensus rules, and hard vs. soft forks, warning that the danger isn’t one dramatic break but precedent and process, changes pushed with limited rough consensus because centralization lowers the friction. The counterweight is re-decentralizing block construction: more node-running miners, home/SMB setups, waste-heat use cases, and business models less dependent on fiat financing that prioritizes scale over alignment with Bitcoin’s incentives.\n\nBest Quotes\n-----------\n\n*   “The pool operator gets to decide what goes into each block. That means there’s a centralized block production industrial complex.”\n*   “Hashers aren’t really miners. They’re just providing hashing power. The mining pools are the true miners because they construct the blocks.”\n*   “With only six or seven pools controlling 90% of blocks, it’s very easy to pressure or coerce them compared to thousands of distributed miners worldwide.”\n*   “Any cartel of pools could decide, for example, not to include Lightning transactions. That’s the kind of scenario centralization makes possible.”\n*   “Consensus rules are meant to be hard to change. Centralization makes it easier, which is the opposite of what Bitcoin should be.”\n*   “The process itself worries me more than the actual change. If developers push something through against community resistance once, they can do it again.”\n*   “Most big miners are fiat businesses, they take on debt, issue bonds, and care more about growing bigger than about Bitcoin. That’s the root problem.”\n*   “Decentralization of mining will ultimately come from entrepreneurs innovating, whether it’s home miners heating their houses or farms capturing waste.”\n*   “Every BitAxe or small home miner adds just a little orphan risk to centralized pools. That costly punishment actually matters.”\n*   “Bitcoin’s ethos is community and consensus. Any whiff of authoritarianism, whether from devs or pools, is a warning sign.”\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nBitcoin’s durability depends on keeping changes hard and decision-making diffuse; concentrated pools invert that logic by making unilateral shifts easier and community signaling weaker. While today’s issues may seem incremental, the long-term risk is cumulative erosion of neutrality through small, precedent-setting moves. The remedy is agency: miners and users running nodes, diversifying pools/clients, experimenting with entrepreneurial energy reuse, and favoring incentives that reward profitability and independence over fiat-fueled growth. Decentralization isn’t aesthetic, it’s the mechanism that preserves Bitcoin’s security, censorship resistance, and social consensus.\n\nTimestamps\n----------\n\n0:00 - Brisket Inflation  \n2:30 - Mining Pools and Stratum V1 Explanation  \n5:49 - Trust Relationships and Hash Rate Distribution  \n7:49 - Mining's Security Function  \n11:21 - Pool Centralization Risks  \n13:38 - Cartel Scenarios and Hard Fork Dynamics  \n17:00 - Censorship vs. Invalidation Scenarios  \n20:50 - Government Pressure and Decentralization Benefits  \n24:30 - Consensus Rules: Hard Forks vs. Soft Forks  \n32:10 - Soft Fork Dynamics and Wipeout Risk  \n34:03 - Relay Policy vs. Consensus Rules  \n39:21 - Op Return Debate and Mining Pool Decision Making  \n46:05 - Developer vs. Miner Centralization Concerns  \n49:32 - Relay Policy Precedent Concerns  \n55:14 - Process Criticism and Community Feedback  \n59:33 - Mining Distribution Impact on Arguments  \n01:04:16 - Contentious Soft Fork Scenarios  \n01:11:25 - Game Theory and Economic Majorities  \n01:16:46 - Fiat Money's Impact on Mining Centralization  \n01:23:42 - Path to Decentralization  \n01:25:33 - Innovation and Home Mining Future\n\nTranscript\n----------\n\n(00:05) Jimmy, thanks for doing this. Topic of the day is mining centralization. But before we get there, I want to quiz you. Just went down the street to Coopers. Got brisket. I want you to guess what the current price of brisket per pound is at Coopers. It's downtown prime location, Austin, which obviously Oh, yeah.  \n(00:36) Obviously, um, very popular around here. I'm going to guess 32.99. 3950. What? Yeah. Do Do you have any recollection? We've been going to Coopers for a long time around bit devs. Do you have any recollection of the earliest price you would have remembered at Coopers? Well, Cooper didn't open until like 5 years ago. No, it it it's been at least 2018.  \n(01:00) Okay. So, 7 years ago, something like that. Yeah. But, um I want to say like 22 299 was maybe like the earliest I can remember. The lowest I saw when I I started going there more frequently when I started Unchained, which would have been 2018, 1799. Yeah. I remember when I first moved to Austin, I went to uh Rudy's.  \n(01:30) I think it was like 629 or something. Yeah, this was 2012. It's just amazing. I I've triggered a number of people carrying the torch on SAFE's ribeye as an inflation index and I'm conditioned to the increase in prices and even at Coopers, I think I went and I saw it at 33 or $34. But there was something about that 3950. Yeah.  \n(01:57) And I know that I've seen it, you know, back in time at the same location. 17.99 more than 100%. Yeah. Just Well, you know, in Bitcoin terms, that's actually quite cheap now. like compared to that. I saw a tweet that you put out about something that you were looking to purchase, seeing that it was some amount more expensive and then realized that it was cheaper in Bitcoin terms.  \n(02:23) And it is it is true that that brisket is still cheaper in Bitcoin terms. Way cheaper. The dollar inflation still still hits. It does. Still hits. It does. Um, start paying attention, freaks. But um all right, on to the real topic of the day, mining centralization and and specifically we're going to get into pool mining pool centralization.  \n(02:48) Explain in your words the relationship between Bitcoin miners and mining pools just to set some context. Right. So the reason why pools exist in the first place is because you want variance reduction, right? Um if you have a tiny amount of hash rate um you have uh you know whatever hash rate you have divided by the global hash rate percentage chance of finding the next block.  \n(03:15) It's obviously not going to be very much. And instead of uh you know waiting for the one jackpot hit if you will, you can pull all of your resources and split it equally. That's what a mining pool is supposed to be. Um unfortunately the first design of mining pool stuff uh uses something called stratum v1 and this is where the mining pool tells everybody hey here's the block you have to mine including this output address that goes to the pool and will do the splitting up afterwards. Um and that means that the pool  \n(03:55) essentially acts as the block template constructor. And in fact for any member of the pool they don't have to run a node at all. They just have to take the template modify it in whatever way to uh roll the nons or whatever and just hash until they find the block right or find really what they do is they find shares and then submit those shares and if the uh pool if they find a block then it gets spread equally.  \n(04:28) That's the idea behind pools and that's how um it's more or less executed. Uh but you know, one of the things that makes it kind of bad is that the pool operator gets to decide what goes into each block. And that means that there's a centralized block production industrial complex, if you will. There's only maybe 15 pools that have something like 95% of the hash rate and uh that that are running stratum v1. Um I think brain brains pool they run stratum v2.  \n(05:05) Um, Ocean obviously runs DATM and then there's like CK solo pool and they they make it so that you can uh mine solo and decide on your um template yourself. Uh, and but they they take up I believe less than 5%. So 95% of hash rate essentially is controlled by like 16 pool operators. And we know that some of them have like economic, you know, interests in the other.  \n(05:38) So, it's probably more like 10 at the most, right? Like entities. Yeah. And so, you mentioned that like most Bitcoin miners, if they're working with a centralized pool, are not running their own node. They don't have to. No. Um, and that when they are performing work, say on-site where they're consuming power and running the Bitcoin hashing algorithm, they're basically their their primary communication channel is back through the pool.  \n(06:10) They they send the pool all of their work and then not only does their work go back through the pool and the pool does the accounting of how much work all the miners participating in their pool do but then the money goes directly to the pool. Mhm. And then they have to get paid out. Yeah. And the pools pay out the miners. Right.  \n(06:36) It's it's a big trust relationship honestly because every hasher, right? Like we shouldn't call these people that are participating in a pool not really running their own nodes or constructing blocks like any an actual minor. They're not really mining as much as they are hashing. The mining pools are mining because they're constructing their own blocks.  \n(06:55) Um but that's they they have to have um this big trust relationship because the pool does the payout, right? Um, and you know, ","sig":"c9741e186d29316f816ec53c6c853be40a7230732661605b9732e0bbf1fa50ab2ed1908f6467342a1af3fe8fa6186b88c5f429a129580c0d1d593a672aaa4faa"}

[Cynthia Lummis](https://bitcoinnews.com/adoption/cynthia-lummis-commends-bitcoin/) (R-WY), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH), Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Rep. Nick Begich (R-AK), Rep. Pat Harrigan (R-NC), House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), House Financial Services Chair French Hill (R-AR), and Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN).\n\nOn the industry side, participants included Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy and one of Bitcoin’s biggest champions, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel, and other execs from mining and digital asset companies.\n\nThe meetings were hosted by advocacy groups like the Digital Chamber, the [Digital Power Network](https://x.com/DigitalPowerUS/status/1968054179479613704), and the new Treasury Council.\n\n![strategic bitcoin reserve meetings](https://bitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/strategic-bitcoin-reserve-meetings.jpg \"US Lawmakers and Digital Asset Execs Meet to Push for Bitcoin Reserve 4\")\n\n_Political figures and well-known digital asset execs took part in the meetings_\n\nThe core proposal, outlined in the BITCOIN Act, would have the U.S. government build a strategic reserve of up to 1 million bitcoin, just like how gold has been held as a national reserve asset.\n\nSupporters say this would strengthen America’s financial position and ensure the country is a leader in the future of digital assets.\n\n_“Legislators and the executives at yesterday’s roundtable agree, there is a need \\[for\\] a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve law to ensure its longevity for America’s financial future,”_ said Hailey Miller, Director of Government Affairs at the Digital Power Network.\n\nThe bill, [reintroduced](https://bitcoinnews.com/adoption/the-bitcoin-act-is-back/) by Sen. Lummis in March, builds on an executive order signed by President Donald Trump which first established the concept of a bitcoin reserve and barred the government from selling bitcoin seized in criminal or civil cases.\n\nLummis’s bill goes further — not just holding seized coins, but also buying more.\n\nAccording to the proposal, the government could use “budget-neutral strategies” to fund the purchases, including revaluing gold certificates and earnings from Federal Reserve banks.\n\n_**Related: [US to Use Tariffs and Gold Revaluation to Build Bitcoin Reserves](https://bitcoinnews.com/adoption/tariffs-gold-strategic-bitcoin-reserves/)**_\n\nMichael Saylor, whose company is the largest public holder of bitcoin with over 638,000 BTC, has been leading the charge. At the roundtable, Saylor said Bitcoin is more than just an investment.\n\n_“Bitcoin represents economic freedom,”_ he said, urging the U.S. to adopt it as a reserve asset to maintain global financial leadership.\n\nSaylor also noted that Bitcoin is already changing the global financial system, and the U.S. must move fast if it wants to stay ahead.\n\n> [](https://twitter.com/BitcoinNewsCom/status/1968802188576063539)\n\nOther executives, including Thiel and Tom Lee of BitMine, agreed and joined the Treasury Council in sending a letter to Congress to pass the bill. The letter said a bitcoin reserve would “hedge against systemic risks” and keep America at the top of the financial world.\n\nThe roundtables also showed growing support within the Republican Party. Speaker Mike Johnson said House Republicans will work “hand in glove” with the industry.\n\n_“We’re in this together,”_ Johnson said at a Bitcoin Voter PAC event after meeting with digital asset execs and lawmakers.\n\n_“(Congress) relies upon the insight and expertise (of the members of the industry) to be able to have policy that allows for further growth and advancement of the industry.”_","sig":"5b693488fb71e276a01f8ae3ad3f9c5e0cf42759b0092364d07912ff82edfcf5b756c8398fb05252c66365671d0e34edf034ca0eca568f6abf6f4fae8c0b6b08"}

The project does not maintain a presence on social media, and all second-hand information should be verified against the content on the official website._\n\nWhat's new\n----------\n\n*   **Tor-Only Implementation**: Ashigaru Whirlpool operates exclusively over Tor, preventing clearnet connections to protect against IP address linking and wallet clustering by malicious coordinators.\n*   **Tor identity isolation** is built in to prevent coordinators from linking session IDs across coinjoin stages, ensuring user network anonymity.\n*   **Enhanced decentralization strategy:** The Tor-only setup eliminates DNS dependency and hides coordinator locations, supporting rapid deployment of new instances.\n\n> \"Our coordinator has been further modularized by eliminating the dependency of RPC connections to a local full node. The coordinator can therefore be connected to any Dojo full node over Tor, enabling faster deployment and recovery, minimal hardware resource requirements, and greater jurisdictional flexibility.\"\n\n*   **Anti-Sybil Measures**: An Anti-Sybil fee, fixed at 5% of pool size, is charged for Tx0 broadcasts to enter pools, with a cap of 20 UTXOs per Tx0 for added Sybil resistance.\n*   **Vulnerability Fixes**: RSA keys for Chaumian blinding are not sent to clients, mitigating potential input-output linking risks and building trust as a new development team.\n*   **Output Restrictions**: Multisig addresses are barred as mix-to outputs in coinjoin cycles to maintain anonymity and compatibility with post-mix tools like Ashigaru mobile and Sparrow.\n*   **Code Improvements**: Numerous under-the-hood fixes and optimizations have been made to Samourai’s forked codebase, including updated dependencies, enhanced performance, and architectural adjustments.\n*   **Ashigaru Terminal**: Forked from Sparrow, Ashigaru Terminal defaults to .onion Electrum servers for privacy, with options for private server connections via Tor or clearnet.\n    *   Only native SegWit Whirlpool account paths are supported for hot wallets, with mandatory BIP39 passphrases; unsupported wallet types include Legacy, Wrapped SegWit, Taproot, and multisig scripts.\n    *   Tx0 fee estimation targets next-block confirmation, advising users to wait for lower rates if block space competition is high.\n\n> \"Remote and automatic update of Tor URLs for connecting to both Ashigaru Whirlpool and for transaction broadcast using our “Hanzaki” feature will be coming in a future release,\" was stated in a blog post.\n\nQuick guide\n-----------\n\n*   Check out this [quick overview](https://k3tan.com/ashigaru-whirlpool/) by _k3tan_ to learn how to use the new Ashigaru Terminal:\n\n> \"My advice is to take a measured approach to this. This is new software and there may still be bugs. Start small, get comfortable, then level up progressively. Don't expect mixes straight away. It's important to be patient.

Institutional landlords overbuilt luxury units, are underwater in key metros, and may trigger localized distress. With 15.6M boomers aging out by 2035 and housing used as a speculative store of value, she expects rising delinquencies now and a meaningful foreclosure wave starting in 2026 as FHA “guardrails” end serial modifications.\n\nBest Quotes\n-----------\n\n*   “The FHA program today is what subprime was last time, 13% of the market and headed for trouble.”\n*   “Even if rates go lower, you’re not going to have a lot of people who qualify.”\n*   “We had the lowest first-time home buyers on record last year. The median age of a new homeowner is now 56.”\n*   “Being a landlord is not going to be cool. It’s not cool.”\n*   “Housing has to become boring again.”\n*   “Whatever they try to do to help the boomers is going to crush the younger generations.”\n*   “The worst thing you can be in right now is in debt. Debt slavery will crush you.”\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nWright’s prescription is to stop engineering outcomes, let prices normalize, and make housing “boring” again, shelter first, not a casino. Bailouts to protect boomers risk further crushing younger generations; solutions should refocus locally (stronger city planning, repurposing vacant stock) while households avoid leverage in a volatile credit cycle. Without a credible path to affordability and hope for younger Americans, economic and social strain will intensify.\n\nTimestamps\n----------\n\n0:00 - Intro  \n1:33 - Mortgage Crisis Signals Return  \n3:50 - Affordability Crisis & Government Lending  \n8:08 - Housing Costs vs Bitcoin Store of Value  \n16:01 - Bitkey & Unchained  \n17:42 - Supply Myths & Melody's Housing Tour  \n29:18 - Obscura & SLNT  \n31:31 - Historical Cycles & Auto Crisis Leading  \n40:27 - Opportunity Cost  \n41:11 - Bailouts vs Generational Solutions  \n54:34 - Bitcoin Innovation & Local Community Focus  \n1:05:45 - FHA Changes & Rising System Costs\n\nTranscript\n----------\n\n(00:00) They put the guard rails on this FHA program which could single-handedly take down this market. This is going to be uglier than most people think. They're underwater. They're getting hit with property taxes, insurance, at the same time their cost of funds to keep that Ponzi scheme going. We have seen unprecedented intervention.  \n(00:18) So many people took forbbearances during co we have the highest folks working two jobs that we've ever seen. After 2008, the banks really stepped back out of the mortgage market. You only have to have 3 and 12% down. That share of the market right now is around 13% which is about the share of what subprime was the last time things started falling apart.  \n(00:36) I think the banks want them out of mortgage. There's going to be a cycle where they've brought everybody in they can possibly bring in. But it is a ponzi. It's a drug and it becomes very addictive. These were middle class people that were coming and moving. Ultimately, they're being priced out. So even if rates go lower, you're not going to have a lot of people who are going to be able to qualify.  \n(00:53) We had the lowest first-time home buyers on record last year. 15.6 6 million boomers are going to age out between now and 2035 and they own the majority of homes. We had all this built for rent. All the homes were empty and and I was just like, what is going on? A lot of them look like army barracks. It's all luxury.  \n(01:09) It's like everybody forgot who lives in this country. We might see a bailout in the form of Fanny and Freddy, a government agency, buying back the homes from private equity. By privatizing, I think that Fanny and Freddy would suicide themselves. Being a landlord is not going to be cool. It's not cool. Whatever they try to do to help the boomers is going to crush the younger generations.  \n(01:34) Melody Wright, welcome to the show. Thank you for joining me. Well, thank you so much for having me. It's my pleasure. Well, as I was I was saying before we hit record, I was on Michael Ferris's show, Coffee and Mike, last week and after our conversation off the record, he said you have to reach out to Melody.  \n(01:51) I was telling him I'm in the market to buy a house. uh where I live in the northeast in the Philadelphia area and you've been on his show. I've since my conversation with Michael watched a few of the podcasts you've been on in recent months and I think this is a conversation that I'm not only going to get value out of but we have a lot of millennials Gen Xers uh in the audience who are probably in a similar position than I am. So I'm really happy to jump in and talk about the real estate market with you. Awesome. Looking forward to it.  \n(02:22) Yeah. And like I said, I wanted to open with a chart. You come with a bunch of quantitative hard data. Uh something I like to follow not only in real estate but just generally is is Google trends. And if we look at Google trends right now particularly for the search help with mortgage we are at uh we have reached uh March 2009 levels. Yeah. Yes.  \n(02:52) Uh this is not surprising at all. Um and you know what's crazy about this though, Marty, is if you think about it, we have seen unprecedented uh intervention already and loan modifications and workouts that you know so many people took um forbearances during co and once those forbearances were over um you know you could go up to 18 months of not making payments.  \n(03:18) You had to have some sort of workout to deal with those foreborn payments. And so what many people did was a payment deferral if you had a Fanny or Freddy loan or a partial claim if you had a FHA and they put it at the back of the loan to be paid off when you sell the home or pay off the mortgage. Um and then many people did modifications as well uh reducing their payment.  \n(03:41) So this is quite shocking because we've had intervention that far outweighs what we saw after the last housing crisis and yet people need help with their mortgage. And what is driving this uh specifically? You think it's um the labor market, people becoming unemployed, not being able to afford it. Is it mainly homeowners who got um committed to adjustable rate mortgages and with the mortgage rate being above 6% their their payments just became too much is a combination of things. It's a combination of things.  \n(04:17) um and based but you know a lot of it is yes the labor market is weak you know we have kind of um the highest uh folks working two jobs and those are part-time jobs right now um that we've ever seen and so you know I think the labor market has been weak for some time but people got into mortgages they couldn't afford um what a lot of people don't understand about this market is that after uh 2008 the banks really stepped back out of the mortgage market this was because of Basel 3 requirements the supplement or leverage ratio, things like that. And the non-bank stepped in, but they did um  \n(04:51) they're funded basically by the government sponsored enterprises and agencies. And so what you have now is a largely government market and um the FHA program specifically kind of stepped in where private was last time with subprime. Um people getting mortgages with credit scores of 580 if you have a big down payment, for instance. Uh you only have to have three and a half% down.  \n(05:16) And so that share of the market right now is around 13%. Which is about the share of what subprime was the last time things started falling apart. And so people just simply can't afford it. And and something I said years ago is that we wouldn't even have to have a deteriorating labor market to see a crisis because property taxes and insurance have risen so much that people simply what you know they were already taking out um too much leverage that they really couldn't afford.  \n(05:45) you know, based on uh these loans they were getting from these government agencies, but then you tack on uh property taxes and insurance. And I've seen um you know, your mortgage serer pays those and they put it into your payment. And I've seen escrow notices go out saying we're sorry.  \n(06:04) Uh well, they don't even really say we're sorry, but you know, hey, your payment has just increased uh it's just doubled because like if you're in California, for instance, because of that insurance increase after the fires and and property taxes. So, I think it's just a real affordability crisis at this point. Yeah. And you property taxes are interest. They've been a topic of conversation the last couple of podcasts, particularly after Ronda Santis started on his campaign trail of eliminating property taxes in Florida specifically, and I think I forget who it was, but basically described property taxes as unrealized cap gains taxes that are really pushing people out of the market.  \n(06:40) And I imagine they are affecting uh the boomers the most in retirement age. They thought they had their nest egg in their retirements account, the retirement accounts. They're looking at their average mortgage payment and say, \"Okay, we need to hit this level.  \n(07:00) We could sustain these payments and buy food and go on trips and whatever.\" And then you see inflation across the board and the triple whammy, I guess, with with property taxes going up as well. Yep.

Hayek, The Constitution of Liberty\n\n\\&gt; *“\\[Life] aims at a form of cooperation among men to be based entirely on the free intercourse and free association of individuality with individuality. Here human individuality will not be forced into an institutional mold.” -* Rudolf Steiner, Towards Social Renewal: Rethinking the Basis of Society\n\n\\---\n\n**I. The Problem of Modern Freedom**\n\nModern life confronts us with a paradox. On the surface, freedom abounds; we can choose our careers, our beliefs, our identities, and our associations more than most any generation before us. Yet beneath this abundance, a hollowness grows. Freedom feels weightless, fragmented, even exhausting. We drift between institutions that no longer command trust and systems that no longer cohere. The question presses: *what is freedom for, and how can it live in harmony with order?*\n\nThis is not a new question. A century ago, two very different thinkers wrestled with it in the crucible of history. Rudolf Steiner, the Austrian-born philosopher, wrote in the wreckage of World War I, insisting that social life could only recover if grounded in spiritual freedom. Friedrich A. Hayek, economist of the Austrian school, wrote in the shadow of World War II, warning that the dreams of central planners would lead not to prosperity but to tyranny.\n\nSteiner believed the task of modernity was to design new social forms – a *moral architecture* that liberated human creativity from state and economic coercion. Hayek believed the task was to protect the social forms already at work – the *spontaneous order* of law, prices, and tradition that no central mind could improve upon. One urged conscious design; the other, humility before emergent order.\n\nFor all their differences, both shared a conviction; freedom is not chaos, nor is order necessarily control. A society can be coherent without being coerced. The individual, if given dignity, agency, and responsibility, can contribute to the fabric of the whole.\n\nTheir dialogue, separated by time yet joined by theme, is more than an academic curiosity. In the 21st century, with the emergence of Bitcoin and other decentralized networks, like Nostr, their ideas converge in living form. Bitcoin is not merely a digital currency; it is a mediator between Steiner’s moral imagination and Hayek’s spontaneous order. It shows how freedom can become structure, and how structure can preserve freedom.\n\nThe old paradox of modern liberty – the abundance that feels empty – meets here a new possibility; coherence without command, responsibility without rulers, order without domination.\n\n**II. Steiner’s Moral Architecture**\n\nRudolf Steiner approached the problem of freedom not as a question of policy but as a question of spirit. For him, society was like a living organism. Just as a human being thrives when thinking, feeling, and willing each play their proper part, so too does society thrive when its three realms – culture, politics, and economy – are allowed to unfold according to their own principles.\n\nIn Steiner’s vision, culture requires *freedom*; education, art, science, and religion must be liberated from both state decrees and market pressures. A school or university should arise from the initiative of teachers and communities, not from bureaucrats or shareholders. Culture flourishes when ideas and imaginations are free to cross-pollinate without fear of censorship or commodification.\n\nPolitics, in turn, requires *equality*; each citizen equal before the law, each voice counted equally in the shaping of rights. Political life, Steiner insisted, must be insulated from economic power. When corporations can purchase legislation, or when governments dictate thought, the sphere of rights becomes distorted. Equality demands impartiality – one person, one vote, free of financial coercion.\n\nFinally, economics requires *fraternity*. By this Steiner did not mean forced collectivism, but cooperative association. Economic life, he argued, should aim to meet real human needs, not merely to maximise profit. Producers, consumers, and traders should work together to set fair prices and distribute goods in ways that respect dignity. He spoke of a “world economy” built on mutual service, in contrast to both cutthroat competition and nationalist protectionism.\n\nThe core of Steiner’s social philosophy was *moral freedom*. Freedom is not licence or whim, but the capacity of the individual to act from insight – what he called “ethical individualism.” When people are liberated to follow their moral imagination, they do not descend into chaos; they discover within themselves the creative impulses that build meaning and community.\n\nSteiner saw institutions not as cages but as vessels. If individuals are the flame, then social forms must be the lamp that shelters and magnifies that flame. A society worthy of the name is one that allows its people to awaken as ethical beings and contribute their unique gifts. Without just structure, even noble souls are thwarted. Without free souls, even the best structures are dead.\n\nIn Steiner’s thought, freedom is inseparable from form. He called for a threefold social order not to fragment society, but to protect each realm so that the human being could develop as whole. This was his moral architecture; coherence without coercion, order that nurtures freedom rather than suffocating it.\n\n**III. Hayek’s Spontaneous Order**\n\nWhere Steiner began with ideals of conscience and structure, Friedrich Hayek began with humility. He asked a disarmingly simple question; *how is it that society works at all?* How do millions of strangers, each with their own fragment of knowledge, coordinate their lives without chaos?\n\nHayek’s answer was that order does not need to be imposed because it emerges. The scattered decisions of individuals, each responding to their own circumstances, can weave together into a coherent pattern – so long as freedom allows their signals to flow.\n\nAt the heart of this order is the price system. A price is not just a number, it is information. It compresses a vast web of knowledge; about scarcity, demand, opportunity, and risk, into a signal that anyone can act upon. The genius of the market, Hayek observed, is that no one needs to understand the whole picture. A baker does not need to know why the cost of wheat has risen, only that it has; she adapts, and in doing so she joins a chain of responses that stretches across continents.\n\nThis coordination, achieved without command, struck Hayek as nothing short of miraculous. He called it “a mechanism for communicating information,” a distributed intelligence greater than any central planner could design. The paradox is that this marvel is overlooked precisely because it is not designed. Intellectuals scorn it as chaos, yet it is more rational than their blueprints; a living order, not a mechanical plan.\n\nFrom this insight flowed Hayek’s fierce defence of liberty. If knowledge is dispersed, then any attempt to concentrate control – whether through state planning or monopolistic power – cripples society’s ability to adapt. Economic control, he argued, is never just economic. It becomes control over every choice, every end. “The more the state plans,” he warned, “the more difficult planning becomes for the individual.”\n\nFreedom, for Hayek, is not an indulgence. It is a necessity for civilization. Competition becomes a discovery process, testing possibilities. The rule of law becomes the stable framework within which individuals can plan their lives. Tradition and custom, far from being relics, carry the distilled wisdom of generations, practices that proved their worth even if we no longer fully understand why.\n\nHayek’s vision is evolutionary rather than utopian. He distrusted those who sought to redesign society in pursuit of abstract ideals like “social justice.” The institutions that sustain cooperation – property rights, contracts, trust – were not invented by committee. They grew through centuries of trial and error. To discard them in the name of progress is to saw off the branch upon which civilization rests.\n\nIn this way, Hayek presents freedom as an emergent architecture. It is not a grand design but an unfolding tapestry. Individuals, left free under impartial rules, generate patterns more complex and more humane than any authority could impose. To submit to this order of prices, traditions, and the rule of law is paradoxically to gain more than we could ever command.\n\nFor Hayek, freedom was the discipline of reality. It is the humility to recognise our limits, and the trust that through voluntary cooperation, society can achieve coherence beyond the reach of any ruler’s hand.\n\n**IV. The Shared Ethic of Decentralization**\n\nSteiner and Hayek, for all their differences, circle around a common truth; freedom flourishes when life is decentralized. Both saw the danger in concentrating power, whether in the state, the market, or the mind of a planner. Both believed that coherence emerges when responsibility is distributed, when individuals are free to act yet bound together by trust, law, or conscience.\n\nFor Steiner, decentralization meant creating space for moral imagination. The cultural sphere must be independent so that teachers, artists, and thinkers could act from their own highest insight, rather than from orders handed down by governments or corporate boards. His faith was that when human beings are inwardly free, they will naturally contribute to the greater good. Coercion stifles the moral flame; freedom calls it forth.\n\nFor Hayek, decentralization was the only way to make use of society’s dispersed knowledge. No planner, however well-intentioned, could match the subtle intelligence embedded in the free actions of millions. But this freedom is not license. It demands virtue; honesty in contracts, respect for property, trust in strangers. The market itself disciplines those who cheat or exploit. Over time, only those who respect the rules of fair exchange endure.\n\nBoth men, then, linked decentralization to responsibility. Steiner’s freedom is “freedom for” – for service, for creativity, for truth. Hayek’s freedom is the freedom to choose, and therefore to bear the consequences of choice. Each saw that a decentralized society requires inner discipline. It cannot run on force; it must run on trust.\n\nOne spoke of conscience, the other of custom. One of moral imagination, the other of inherited wisdom. But neither believed that people must be forced into goodness. They believed, rather, that under the right conditions, goodness grows of its own accord.\n\nIn this light, decentralization is not anarchy. It is an ethic. It demands that we – participate freely, consciously, and with care. It is here, in this shared ethic, that the ideas of Steiner and Hayek bend toward one another. And it is here that Bitcoin enters the conversation. For Bitcoin is not only a new form of money. It is a living experiment in decentralized ethics, one that unites moral architecture with spontaneous order in code.\n\n**V. Bitcoin as Mediator and Mirror**\n\nBitcoin did not arrive as a manifesto, nor as a party program. It emerged quietly, in 2009, as lines of code written by someone who vanished. Yet in its curious birth, it carried both intention and withdrawal; engineered with care, then released to grow on its own. In this, it already bore the marks of both Steiner and Hayek – the architecture of vision, and the humility of emergence.\n\nFrom Hayek’s perspective, Bitcoin is the purest form of free-market money. It is denationalised currency, immune to central planning, coordinated by the knowledge of thousands of nodes and millions of users. No one controls its supply. No one dictates its value. Prices emerge on open exchanges, conveying information; signals of scarcity and demand across the globe. Bitcoin embodies Hayek’s insight that freedom is not chaos but coordination, achieved through dispersed knowledge and voluntary exchange.\n\nFrom Steiner’s perspective, Bitcoin is equally remarkable. It severs the economy’s most vital organ – money – from the grasp of the state, allowing it to function as an independent realm. It is borderless, apolitical, and global, echoing his vision of a world economy beyond nationalism and coercion. Its governance, though digital, is associational; miners, developers, and users must reach consensus, not by decree but through transparent protocols. In every block and every transaction, Bitcoin encodes the principles of honesty, fairness, and trustworthiness. It is not simply “trustless”; it is a structure that fosters trust by making deception impossible.\n\nIn Bitcoin, form carries meaning. Its fixed supply, transparent ledger, and open rules are not neutral technicalities, they are moral choices. They forbid certain corruptions, like arbitrary inflation or selective privilege, and reward virtues like patience, prudence, and responsibility. To hold Bitcoin is to learn self-custody, to withstand volatility, to take responsibility for one’s keys. These are not just technical disciplines; they are moral exercises.\n\nOne might say Bitcoin is a lens. Refracting and clarifying every action – whether saving, verifying, or transacting – into consequences that cannot be denied or erased. It makes responsibility visible. Competition becomes cooperation, not through decree, but through alignment with the protocol’s rhythm. Every ten minutes, a new block joins the chain, a steady pulse of accord across the globe. Out of countless disparate actions, coherence emerges, as if scattered voices were drawn into a single harmony without ever losing their independence.\n\n Here, Steiner’s moral architecture and Hayek’s spontaneous order converge. Bitcoin was consciously designed, but its designer disappeared, allowing it to evolve as an open, voluntary order. It requires both inner conviction (to run a node, to safeguard keys, to value autonomy) and external discipline (to follow consensus rules, to submit to proof-of-work). It is both moral imagination crystallised in form and emergent order arising from free cooperation.\n\nIn this sense, Bitcoin is not merely an invention. It is an incarnation. It is the spiral of sovereignty rendered in code; deliberate in its design, yet open to evolution; strict in its rules, yet alive with possibility. At once embodying both the moral architecture Steiner envisioned and the spontaneous order Hayek defended. An ethical bridge where both meet, not in theory but in practice.\n\n**VI. Tensions and Synthesis**\n\nBefore accepting Bitcoin as some remarkable alignment between Steiner and Hayek, we should not overlook the tensions between them. Their differences reveal not only competing philosophies but also enduring dilemmas in how freedom is best secured.\n\nSteiner was a visionary. He called for a conscious re-shaping of society along ethical and spiritual lines. His threefold social order was not a suggestion for gradual reform but a blueprint for transformation, born of the conviction that only radical redesign could heal the fractures of his age. Hayek, by contrast, mistrusted blueprints. He warned that the arrogance of planners – no matter how noble their intentions – led societies into catastrophe. For him, order must emerge and grow, not be planned and built. His counsel was patience, not reconstruction.\n\nThis divergence reveals their temperaments. Steiner placed great trust in the individual’s capacity for moral insight, even intuition of higher truths. Hayek placed equal emphasis on the individual’s limits; in particular, their ignorance, their fallibility, their need for external rules and inherited customs to guide them. Steiner’s free human being is almost heroic; capable of grasping ideals and living them into reality. Hayek’s free human being is humbler; capable of participating responsibly, but only within frameworks that history has proven resilient.\n\nTheir views on economic life also diverged. Hayek celebrated markets as discovery processes that channel self-interest into cooperation. Steiner saw in capitalism a danger of reducing human beings to cogs in a profit machine. His appeal to fraternity was an attempt to re-humanise economic life. To Steiner, Hayek’s faith in market order might seem soulless; to Hayek, Steiner’s economic associations might look like fragile guilds at risk of corruption.\n\nAnd yet, despite these tensions, Bitcoin suggests a middle path. It carries Steiner’s moral intentionality of an architecture that encodes fairness, honesty, and limits, yet it grows and adapts through Hayekian trial and error. It demands that individuals awaken to responsibility, while simultaneously humbling them before the larger order of code and consensus. It is prescriptive in its rules, but descriptive in its adoption. It does not promise utopia, but rather shapes behaviour toward responsibility and cooperation.\n\nSteiner and Hayek might never have agreed on what freedom required. But Bitcoin shows that their opposition need not end in contradiction. Instead, it can become a polarity – two forces pulling against one another, creating tension, and in that tension, coherence.\n\n**VII. Conclusion: The Coherence to Come**\n\nFreedom has always risked dissolving into chaos or hardening into control. The state promises order but at the price of coercion; markets promise dynamism but risk alienation; visions of renewal rise only to collapse under the weight of their own hubris. Steiner and Hayek wrestled with these dilemmas from opposite ends. One seeking to design moral architecture, the other urging trust in the wisdom of emergent order. Each saw only part of the truth.\n\nBitcoin offers a glimpse of the whole. It is not utopia, nor is it chaos. It is a system that coheres without compulsion, a structure that requires responsibility rather than demanding obedience. Its form is inseparable from its meaning; scarcity that teaches patience, transparency that enforces honesty, decentralization that distributes power. In it, we find the moral intentionality of Steiner and the spontaneous order of Hayek, not as abstractions but as lived practice.\n\nTo participate in Bitcoin is to experience freedom as structure, not as whim. One cannot appeal to rulers to rewrite the rules; no, one must adapt, align, and take responsibility. Yet within that discipline lies autonomy and sovereignty; the ability to act with purpose and dignity; to save for the future; to transact without coercion; and, to join a global order that is not imposed from above but chosen from below; ground up.\n\nThis is coherence to come; not the brittle order of centralisation, nor the fragmentation of isolated autonomy, but a harmony that emerges when individuals freely participate in structures that both constrain and empower. Bitcoin is not the end of history. It is the turning of a spiral, a pattern that returns us to the question Steiner and Hayek once posed; *how can freedom live with order?*\n\nThe answer, at least in part, is before us. In every block, in every verified transaction, we see that freedom and coherence are not enemies but partners. The spiral turns, and with each turn, responsibility deepens.

Flaring, the burning of excess natural gas during oil extraction, is a major environmental problem, releasing millions of tons of CO2e (CO2 equivalents) in the form of methane and other toxic pollutants into the atmosphere annually. The problem is, flaring only burns 91.1% of the methane, so the other 8.9% goes unburnt directly into the atmosphere. This contributes to climate change significantly because methane is 84 times more warming over a 20 year period than CO2. In regions like the Middle East, flaring has been shown to cause more harm than previously thought, with recent studies revealing higher levels of toxic gases like benzene and sulfur dioxide (source: World Bank Global Gas Flaring Tracker, 2023). Despite the urgency, progress to end flaring has been slow. While there are many factors at play, but one of the most significant barrier is also the most overlooked: environmental NGOs themselves, specifically a small handful of the more ideologically-driven activist environmental NGOs. These organizations, while well-intentioned, have consistently criticized and undermined almost all efforts from outside commercial organizations to collaborate with oil and gas companies to reduce flaring. In this article, we’ll examine how this tendency to label such initiatives as “greenwashing,” their failure to offer viable alternatives, and their creation of an environment of fear have disincentivized other industries from partnering with oil companies to address this critical issue. The result? Flaring continues unabated and the environment, that these NGOs exist to be faithful stewards to, suffers. False positives: The harmful side-effect of calling something “greenwash” that’s not One counter-productive tendency of these NGOs has been their eagerness to label any and all collaboration with oil and gas companies as “greenwashing.” This term, which refers to superficial or misleading environmental claims, has become a catch-all critique for any effort to reduce flaring. These environmental NGO critiques are often reactive rather than analytical. For instance, when General Electric (GE) and Baker Hughes developed technologies to capture and utilize stranded gas, environmental groups like Sierra Club and Greenpeace accused them of “enabling continued fossil fuel extraction” without acknowledging the tangible emissions reductions these technologies achieved (source: Sierra Club Statement, 2020; Greenpeace International, 2020). By focusing on ideological purity rather than measurable outcomes, these NGOs have created a chilling effect, discouraging companies from pursuing innovative solutions to flaring. Incredibly, these criticisms have continued even when direct, measurable, and significant reduction of methane emissions has been the result. For example, when Crusoe Energy, a Bitcoin mining company, partnered with oil producers to convert flared gas into electricity, Jesse Simons, Deputy Director of Sierra Club’s Beyond Dirty Fuels Campaign, dismissed the initiative as “propping up the fossil fuel industry” (source: Sierra Club Press Release, 2022). Similarly, John Noël, Senior Climate Campaigner at Greenpeace USA, criticized ExxonMobil’s pilot project with Crusoe in the Permian Basin, calling it a “distraction from the urgent need to phase out fossil fuels entirely” (source: Greenpeace USA Statement, 2021). Criticism Without Solutions Another issue is the tendency of these NGOs to criticize without offering alternatives. For example, when BP partnered with Climeworks, a carbon capture company, to explore using captured methane for industrial purposes, and when Shell worked with Enerflex, a gas processing company to reduce flaring at their oilfields, Carroll Muffett, President of the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), accused both companies of using flaring reduction as a “public relations tool” (source: CIEL Press Release, 2021). Similarly, Friends of the Earth criticized waste-to-energy startup Ener-Core for “perpetuating the fossil fuel economy” without proposing a practical alternative for addressing stranded gas (source: Friends of the Earth Report, 2019). While it is an absolutely legitimate function of an environmental NGO to help the public understand when genuine greenwash is at play, the universal tendency across NGOs to label all collaborations with oil companies to end flaring as “greenwash” suggests strongly that there is neither analysis nor discrimination at play here on the part of these environmental NGOs, rather guilty verdict by virtue of the fact one would deign to partner with an oil company. Well, if outside organizations cannot partner with oil companies to deal with methane emissions, oil companies will continue with their own solution: flaring. The environment deserves better service than that. This pattern of criticism without constructive solutions is not only unhelpful but counterproductive. Flaring is a complex problem that requires immediate action. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that oil will still account for 22% of global energy demand in 2050, even in a net-zero scenario (source: IEA Net Zero by 2050 Report, 2021). Given this reality, the choice is not between oil production and no oil production—it is between flaring/venting and utilizing the gas in a way that reduces emissions. By dismissing efforts to address flaring without offering viable alternatives, these NGOs have effectively pushed the industry toward the most environmentally harmful option: continued flaring. How an Environment of Fear Disincentivizes Collaboration Perhaps the most counterproductive consequence of these NGOs’ actions is the environment of fear they have created. Companies that might otherwise partner with oil and gas producers to reduce flaring are often deterred by the risk of reputational damage. For example, renewable energy developers like NextEra Energy and Ørsted have considered using stranded gas for power generation but faced backlash from groups like 350.org and Oil Change International. These organizations accused NextEra of “betraying its renewable energy mission” and Ørsted of “legitimizing the fossil fuel industry” (source: 350.org Press Release, 2021; Oil Change International Report, 2021). This environment of fear has stifled innovation and collaboration. Waste-to-energy startups, renewable energy developers, and even technology giants like GE and Baker Hughes have been reluctant to engage with oil and gas companies, fearing the wrath of activist NGOs. The result is a missed opportunity to reduce emissions and accelerate the transition to a cleaner energy future. Bitcoin Mining: A Pragmatic Exception In this context, Bitcoin mining has emerged as a rare exception. Companies like Crusoe Energy and Upstream Data have been willing to partner with oil producers to convert flared gas into electricity, reducing emissions and generating economic value. These initiatives have been praised by the World Economic Forum for their tangible impact on flaring reduction, even as they face criticism from some NGOs. Crusoe’s projects in North Dakota and Wyoming have reduced flaring by over 90% at partnered sites (source: Crusoe Energy Case Studies, 2023). Similarly, Upstream Data’s operations in Canada have prevented millions of tons of CO2-equivalent emissions annually (source: Upstream Data Reports, 2022). Bitcoin mining’s success in addressing flaring highlights the importance of focusing on outcomes over ideology. NGOs like Sierra Club and Greenpeace were highly criticized of these partnerships at their inception, but have not acknowledged the measurable emissions reductions they ended up achieving. Analysis before ideology For us to have any hope of working collaboratively to end flaring, it’s critical for enviromental NGOs to step up and stop crying “greenwash” without analysis, as has been their tendency, to the detriment of the environment and collaborative action. The fight against flaring is too important to be derailed by ideological purity, and there is a phrase in the environmental movement that they would do well to remember “the perfect is the enemy of the good”. While the intentions of activist NGOs are good, good intentions divorsed from nuanced thinking can and has been counterproductive to the very environmental progress they only exist to create. Their reactive criticism, lack of viable alternatives, and creation of an environment of fear have hindered progress on this critical issue. To truly address flaring, we need a new approach—one that prioritizes measurable outcomes and encourages collaboration. These critiques, while well-intentioned, are misguided. By discouraging collaboration with oil companies, these NGOs inadvertently push the industry to deal with methane emissions in the most environmentally harmful way: flaring or venting. Continued inaction is simply not an option. It’s time for environmental organizations to stop criticicing every imperfect effort to move forward, and get their own house in order. In practical terms, this means: Properly evaluating whether collaborations are greenwash, or whether they can make a measurable difference Learning to work alongside commercial operations to better understand their motivations and strategies before simply criticizing them Taking time to do their own research, including engaging with experts in the domain (something that has been conspicuous by its absent in NGOs criticisms of Bitcoin mining and other industries) Take responsibility for the fact that they have the power to aid environmental progress, but equally the power to hinder progress through criticizing they may not fully understand and which may in fact be a solution, or part of the solution. Free themselves from the trap of overzealously declaring “greenwashing” even when it’s a false positive, and focus on what really matters: working collaboratively to reduce emissions and protecting the environment."],["image","https://batcoinz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/LogoMakr-5Ig93s.png"],["client","Pure Signal"],["t","Bitcoin"]],"content":"The World Bank set an ambitious goal: eliminate nearly [all gas flaring by 2030](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/zero-routine-flaring-by-2030).

It’s time for environmental organizations to stop criticicing every imperfect effort to move forward, and get their own house in order. In practical terms, this means:\n\n1.  Properly evaluating whether collaborations are greenwash, or whether they can make a measurable difference\n2.  Learning to work alongside commercial operations to better understand their motivations and strategies before simply criticizing them\n3.

The busywork that fills your day can now be done in minutes.\n\nThis isn’t an AI chatbot that makes generic suggestions. Your Notion Agent tackles real work because it understands your work and can take action. It can complete multiple actions at a time, creating finished pages, databases, and reports directly in your workspace. Just assign the tasks, and your Agent does the work.\n\nWe believe it’s the most advanced knowledge work agent designed for teams, and we’re so excited to show you how it works.\n\nFrom busywork to life’s work\n\nOur mission is to help people build beautiful tools for their life's work. But most of our time is actually spent on busywork.\n\nIt’s 3 pm on a Thursday. You have follow‑ups to write, the team is waiting for the project plan you promised, and you’re still hunting through docs and messages for that one decision from last week. Then suddenly, the day is over.\n\nWouldn't it be nice if you could spend more time on your life's work, and less time on busywork? With your Agent, you can.\n\nWe all want more time back. AI agents promise to help, but they can’t deliver when your work is scattered across tons of rigid tools. A great AI agent understands your work, is built for collaboration, and can take action.

Put another way, all of the computers running the Hashcash SHA-256 algorithm and pointing their hashes at the bitcoin network are, collectively, producing 1 SEXTILLION HASHES **_PER SECOND_** in hopes of finding the hash below the current difficulty target that enables them to add a block of transactions to the ledger. Truly awe inspiring when you take a step back and think about it.\n\nThe collective capital, energy and risk that is taken on a daily basis to acquire bitcoins by participating in an open and free market for transaction validation and ordering that ensures that individuals who are so motivated have access to an open and permissionless monetary system with a hard capped supply and no trusted third parties is mind boggling. The most impressive part of this feat is that it materialized in a completely emergent and grassroots fashion. Sure, there are massive corporations that now exist with the sole intent of mining bitcoin at massive scales, but the path to this point was paved by a collective of individuals who plugged computers in, ran some software that enabled them to mine bitcoin, noticed inefficiencies and ways they could turn them into efficiencies, and built a multi-billion dollar industry to achieve those efficiencies.\n\nThe breadth of the bitcoin mining landscape spans from bookcases housing [Bitaxes](https://bitaxe.org/?ref=tftc.io) to gigawatt scale data centers participating in demand response programs to help balance the most important energy infrastructure that we depend on every day; grids. It's a beautiful thing.\n\nAnother thing that this milestone screams to me is just how resilient the bitcoin network is. For those who have forgotten, the Chinese government banned bitcoin mining in the Spring/Summer of 2021. As a result, the network hashrate fell by more than 50% from ~170 EH/s to ~83 EH/s.\n\n[![The Bitcoin Network Just Reached An Insane Mining Milestone](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-10.32.50---PM.png)](https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/hashrate-difficulty?ref=tftc.io#all)\n\nvia [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/hashrate-difficulty?ref=tftc.io#all)\n\nIn just over 4 years hashrate has not only recovered from the post-China ban lows, it has increased by **12.3x**. Simply remarkable. This is where the signal is today. Mining is the heartbeat of the bitcoin network. All of the miners producing 1 sextillion hashes per second exist to aggregate valid transactions in blocks and add them to the ledger every ten minutes on average. Individually dealing with infrastructure costs, execution risks, unknown competitors entering the market and pushing hashrate up, beholden to the whims of bitcoin price volatility and (funnily enough) the weather.\n\nBitcoin is doing just fine. Don't let anyone tell you differently.\n\n### The Deliberate Middle Class Destruction\n\nTom Luongo revealed how banking regulations systematically prevent middle-class Americans from building wealth through homeownership. He explained that Dodd-Frank and Elizabeth Warren's CFPB created barriers making it nearly impossible for small business owners to access mortgages, even with strong incomes.

Regulations often require companies to hold this information for a set number of years but in practice users should assume this data will be held indefinitely. Data is often stored insecurely, which results in frequent [hacks and leaks](https://www.newsweek.com/binance-hack-telegram-kyc-data-extortion-changpeng-zhao-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-1452989?ref=discreetlog.com).  \n*   KYC/AML data collection puts all honest users at risk of theft, extortion, and persecution while being ineffective at stopping crime. Criminals often use [counterfeit, bought, or stolen](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/19/for-200-you-can-trade-crypto-with-a-fake-id/?ref=discreetlog.com) credentials to get around the requirements.

Furthermore, billions of people are excluded from financial services as a result of KYC/AML requirements.\n\nDuring the early days of bitcoin most services did not require this sensitive user data, but as adoption increased so did the surveillance measures. At this point, **most large bitcoin companies are collecting and storing massive lists of bitcoiners, our sensitive personal information, and our transaction history.**\n\n**Lists of Bitcoiners**\n\nKYC/AML policies are a direct attack on bitcoiners. Lists of bitcoiners and our transaction history will inevitably be used against us.  \n  \nOnce you are on a list with your bitcoin transaction history that record will always exist. Generally speaking, tracking bitcoin is based on probability analysis of ownership change. Surveillance firms use various heuristics to determine if you are sending bitcoin to yourself or if ownership is actually changing hands.  You can obtain better privacy going forward by using collaborative transactions such as coinjoin to break this probability analysis.  \n  \nFortunately, you can buy bitcoin without providing intimate personal information. Tools such as [peach](https://peachbitcoin.com/?ref=discreetlog.com), [hodlhodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?ref=discreetlog.com), [robosats](https://learn.robosats.com/?ref=discreetlog.com), [azteco](https://azte.co/?ref=discreetlog.com) and [bisq](https://bisq.network/?ref=discreetlog.com) help; mining is also a solid option: anyone can plug a miner into power and internet and earn bitcoin by mining privately.  \n  \nYou can also earn bitcoin by providing goods and/or services that can be purchased with bitcoin. Long term, circular economies will mitigate this threat: most people will not buy bitcoin - they will earn bitcoin - most people will not sell bitcoin - they will spend bitcoin.  \n  \n**There is no such thing as KYC or No KYC bitcoin, there are bitcoiners on lists and those that are not on lists.**\n\n* * *\n\n_**If you found this post helpful support my work with [bitcoin](https://geyser.fund/project/citadel?ref=discreetlog.com).**_\n\n![KYC Bitcoin: Individuals are on Lists](https://werunbtc.com/donate.png)","sig":"462ab23a4c59693269118bae0d6e5aa1473be56d6c54b006e1da8540301fd58048a19d108473e15b8717c523c811bbe21e2d38bcdcc1026c29b18c4b5a06a7fa"}

Considering the recent jobs reports, revisions, inflation data and the abysmal housing starts data that was published today, many analysts and pundits viewed the 25bps cut as insufficient. Many are claiming that the current environment coupled with the recent 911k downward revision to 2024 jobs numbers warranted a 50bps cut. This was also explicitly expressed by the newest Federal Reserve Board Governor Stephen Miran, who was the only dissenter of this month's meeting.\n\nSpeaking of Miran, it seems that he is also keen on pushing the idea of a \"third mandate\" within the Fed to pursue \"moderate long-term interest rates\", which is something that has been choreographed by the Trump administration throughout the year. A pursuit of \"moderate long-term interest rates\" is also referred to as yield curve control and when governments and central banks commit to yield curve control it represents a point of no return from a policy perspective. Once you start, it is extremely hard to stop. It signals that there is waning demand for your long-term debt and the only way to fix it is to have the central bank step in and buy it to drive down yields. Unless a fiscal miracle occurs and the US federal government is able to meaningfully reduce it's debt burden it's hard to see why many would come back to the market outside of forced allocations.\n\nIf and when this is implemented, it will be a massive phase shift in how the Federal Reserve has operated since its inception in 1913. It will be imperative to save your wealth in a hard asset like bitcoin. Especially when you consider the fact that yield curve control may be entering the equation when parts of the economy are beginning to turn over. Powell admitted today and during his speech in Jackson Hole last month that it has become obvious to him that the focus should turn from inflation to the jobs market after the big revision and continued weakness in recent jobs reports. Today's housing data is also signaling that the real estate market is continuing to slow at an accelerating pace, with new permits being down for the fifth month in a row.\n\n![The Fed's Third Mandate, The Looming Credit Crisis, and Bitcoin](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/09/image-4.png)\n\nvia [Zerohedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/personal-finance/us-housing-starts-building-permits-plunged-august?ref=tftc.io)\n\nTo make the outlook for the Fed even worse, it seems like we may be in the early stages of a credit crisis as is evident by the collapse of the subprime auto lender Tricolor.\n\n![The Fed's Third Mandate, The Looming Credit Crisis, and Bitcoin](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/09/image-5.png)\n\nvia[Unicus](https://x.com/UnicusResearch/status/1968311698932342927?ref=tftc.io)\n\nI sat down and had a wide ranging conversation with Ed Dowd today during which we discussed Tricolor's collapse and its potential knock on effects. In short, Ed believes that this is a symptom of the Trump administration's immigration policy which has resulted in deportations by ICE and self-deportations being driven by subsidies for illegal immigrants that have been axed by the administration. Tricolor's largest customer base were these immigrants and their sudden departure from the country has left Tricolor holding a steaming bag of shit in the form of subprime loans. As you can see from the excerpt above there are a number of banks and credit funds who are scrambling to figure out how large of a write down they're going to have to eat. I have a feeling Tricolor is just the first of many lenders to suffer this fate. With rates still relatively elevated and the economy turning it isn't hard to see how this can cascade rather quickly. Maybe Jerome should have cut by 50bps.\n\nWho knows exactly how this will all play out. The Fed and the Federal government have perfected one thing; kicking the can down the road and extending the lifecycle of irrational markets. And don't let the pundits fool you, the market seems pretty irrational right now when you consider where the stock market is and where forward looking PE ratios sit (above dot com bubble levels) juxtaposed to the economic data and credit stress that has been making headlines in recent months.\n\nI wouldn't be the least bit surprised if we see a massive correction in the short to medium term. The question on my mind is how will bitcoin react? Will it play the roll of \"liquidity hedge\", which we wrote about earlier this year, and be the first asset that people dump to bolster their cash positions? Or will it \"decouple\" and act as a true \"risk-off safe haven\" that acts as a safety net during times of deleveraging and repricing? Time will tell, but I am inclined to remind you all of the argument our friend Matthew Mežinskis has been making for years; monetary policy and macroeconomics only account for 5% of bitcoin price movements despite what everyone likes to think. The other 95% is driven by simple network adoption trends that have been observed in other network goods throughout history.\n\nIf we do see a decoupling, I would argue that it very well could be driven by the fact that we've simply reached the point in the bitcoin network's lifecycle where we've passed an adoption tipping point. Stay frosty out there, freaks.\n\n### Housing Crisis Surpasses 2008 Despite Unprecedented Government Aid\n\nMelody Wright presented compelling evidence that America's housing crisis has surpassed 2008 levels despite massive government intervention. She highlighted that Google searches for \"help with mortgage\" have reached March 2009 peaks, even after unprecedented COVID-era forbearances and loan modifications. Wright noted that property taxes and insurance have doubled many mortgage payments, while the median age of new homebuyers hit a record 56 years old.\n\n> \"We've had intervention that far outweighs what we saw after the last housing crisis. And yet people need help with their mortgage.\"- [Melody Wright](https://x.com/m3_melody?ref=tftc.io)\n\nWright emphasized that first-time homebuyers are at their lowest level since the 1980s, while record numbers work multiple part-time jobs.

The agreement also sets precise limits on the amount each European citizen can hold in the digital currency, a measure designed to prevent bank runs, according to Frankfurt.\n\nChristine Lagarde commented:\n\n> > “The digital euro is not just a means of payment, it is also a political statement concerning the sovereignty of Europe and its capacity to handle payment, including on a cross-border basis, with a European infrastructure and solution.”\n\n### **Digital euro timeline**\n\nDespite progress, the issuance of the digital euro will still take several years. The European Parliament has yet to approve the necessary legislation, with intense debates expected this autumn. The ECB hopes to complete the regulatory framework by June 2026, followed by an additional **three-year** period for the actual issuance of the digital currency.\n\n### **Political resistance in the EU**\n\nThe digital euro project faces some resistance, led by Spanish MEP **Fernando Navarrete Rojas**, a center-right parliamentarian and rapporteur on the digital currency dossier. Navarrete published a 27-page [study](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fernando-navarrete-rojas_the-euro-in-2025-digital-euro-fernando-activity-7368681426386403330-5Idx/?rcm=ACoAACSGzCQBaRZzEFvEEwMSw3t2A8aGH2d1UD8) titled _“Do we really need a digital euro?”_, describing the project as a solution to a non-existent problem.\n\nIn his document, the MEP highlights potential risks:\n\n> > “Amidst the ECB’s shifting narrative, the possible risks associated with a digital euro, such as the destabilising effect it could have on financial stability…data privacy concerns that have sparked significant public debate, and the allocation of additional responsibilities in areas such as fraud prevention and anti money laundering, should be carefully assessed.”\n\nThe post [Digital euro: EU accelerates, but issuance is still years away](https://atlas21.com/digital-euro-eu-accelerates-but-issuance-is-still-years-away/) appeared first on [Atlas21](https://atlas21.com).","sig":"fa602156e17c4392835a96956caa016c27b0835a8512a0641e03a39b3a0f7381efe406e5fcf6f8ac7ebec6fed0064aede2de6a045675003d512700396a062e7f"}

The program offers 2-5 BTC in funding, a four-week residency and access to Bitcoin developers and operators, targeting start-ups with market-ready solutions in financial services and technology. Michael Tanguma, founder of Early Riders and Onramp, a Bitcoin financial services firm, told Bitcoin Magazine, “We focus on consumer investments that have commercial viability today — things that people want and will pay for today.” The Stables accelerator targets start-ups addressing immediate market needs, particularly in Bitcoin financial services, leveraging multi-institution custody for lending, bit bonds, and real estate debt facilities. It has a focus on regions like Latin America, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific, where fiat-to-Bitcoin on-ramps are critical for adoption. It seeks consumer-focused solutions like secure custody, inheritance planning and seamless fiat-to-BTC conversions, addressing challenges where users struggle to enter safely and hold bitcoin. “Historical examples are Lightning and payments. People don’t really use them. We want them to be used, and on the margins they are, but people still have trouble getting into Bitcoin — meaning turning their local fiat currency into BTC, then custodying it in a safe way, thinking about inheritance and all those examples,” Tanguma explained about the type of start-ups they are interested in. He added that, “Google is integrating USDC stablecoins into their new AI programs — we know it will make sense for economic activity in a digital world, especially with AI, to be using satoshis instead because it has a better design surface and more programmability.” The Stables is accepting submissions immediately, selecting five top candidates for a demo day with Early Riders’ limited partners and advisors. The winner receives between 2 and 5 BTC, based on bitcoin’s price and project needs, plus a four-week residency in Texas. The facility provides childcare, wellness amenities and a rural setting to foster focus. The program will run annually, with the initial cohort scheduled for summer 2026. Early Riders emphasizes Bitcoin-driven efficiency: “When you have a cost of capital that is bitcoin… growing on an annual basis anywhere between 30 to 50% a year… you just get really efficient with how you hire, the kind of tools you use,” Tanguma told Bitcoin Magazine. This approach, he said, helps Bitcoin start-ups prioritize sound unit economics over fiat-driven growth. The program is global, with Early Riders’ investments all over the world. “This is a global opportunity. We have a global footprint with investments in the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. We want to encourage Bitcoin investors and rationalists — people who don’t want their money debased — to get excited, learn more and reach out to see how we can plug them in,” Tanguma told Bitcoin Magazine. The accelerator offers a follow-on funding pathway with access to over 50 investors. Tanguma’s experience at Unchained and with high-net-worth clients at Ten31 shapes the focus on multi-institution custody, which he described as offering “10x the security of self-custody but at one-tenth the friction or time.” The Stables aims to support start-ups driving Bitcoin adoption through practical solutions.

Independent Whitepapers, peer reviewed papers, sustainability media companies, mainstream media and specialists in the field of grid operations, energy and renewable generation have all endorsed Bitcoin mining’s growing list of environmental benefits. This is quite a turnaround from 2021, when it was not uncommon for people to believe that Bitcoin mining was bad for the environment, a sentiment that was reinforced by the type of reporting that was done at that time. Bitcoin mining it seems is following the same trend as other disruptive technologies including the Bicycle, The Radio and The Internet, who received negative coverage for a period of time, which then improved as people came to better understand the utility of the technology. The phases that greet disruptive technologies are : phase 1: negative first impressions dominate phase 2: better understanding and mixed reports phase 3: initial negative assessments have been debunked, and positive externalities are not only better understood, but evidenced with real world examples. This article documents Bitcoin coverage and studies from: Independent reports (87.5% show strong environmental benefits) Mainstream media reporting (88.9% highlight Bitcoin’s environmental benefits) Sustainable media reporting (91.1% highlight Bitcoin’s environmental benefits) Peer reviewed articles (80% show strong environmental benefits) which collectively show evidence that Bitcoin has just entered phase three. The document is current as of May 2025. 1. Independent reports 1.

Promoting rigor in blockchain energy and environmental footprint research (Sai & Vranken 2024) Journal: Blockchain-Research and Applications (Impact factor 6.9) Findings: Reveals data-gathering and methodological flaws in the works of Alex de Vries/Digiconomist and other early commentators on Bitcoin mining Summary Only four years ago, it was anomalous to see a report suggesting Bitcoin mining had environmental benefits. Now it is an anomolgy to read a news article, see an independent report, or see a scientific publication that focuses on the negative environmental externalities. This trend appears to have been driven by three factors 1. The natural cycle that accompanies any disruptive technology. 2. The discrediting of earlier first generation studies on Bitcoin mining, which were found to have had substantial methodological flaws. 3. The migration of Bitcoin mining to more sustainable power sources (37.6% in 2021, versus 52.4% in 2025)"],["image","https://batcoinz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/LogoMakr-5Ig93s.png"],["client","Pure Signal"],["t","Bitcoin"]],"content":"![](https://batcoinz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-02-at-8.41.21-PM-788x1024.png)\n\nWhat’s going on?\n\nIndependent Whitepapers, peer reviewed papers, sustainability media companies, mainstream media and specialists in the field of grid operations, energy and renewable generation have all endorsed Bitcoin mining’s growing list of environmental benefits.\n\nThis is quite a turnaround from 2021, when it was not uncommon for people to believe that Bitcoin mining was bad for the environment, a sentiment that was reinforced by the type of reporting that was done at that time. Bitcoin mining it seems is following the same trend as other disruptive technologies including [the Bicycle, The Radio and The Internet](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bitcoin-good-bad-environment-im-confused-daniel-batten-racec/?trackingId=%2FDXbmM%2F0RQ6meOSfjCNPKg%3D%3D), who received negative coverage for a period of time, which then improved as people came to better understand the utility of the technology.\n\n**The phases that greet disruptive technologies are :**\n\n*   phase 1: negative first impressions dominate\n*   phase 2: better understanding and mixed reports\n*   phase 3: initial negative assessments have been debunked, and positive externalities are not only better understood, but evidenced with real world examples.\n\nThis article documents Bitcoin coverage and studies from:\n\n1.  Independent reports (**87.5%** show strong environmental benefits)\n2.  Mainstream media reporting (**88.9%** highlight Bitcoin’s environmental benefits)\n3.

Put another way, all of the computers running the Hashcash SHA-256 algorithm and pointing their hashes at the bitcoin network are, collectively, producing 1 SEXTILLION HASHES **_PER SECOND_** in hopes of finding the hash below the current difficulty target that enables them to add a block of transactions to the ledger. Truly awe inspiring when you take a step back and think about it.\n\nThe collective capital, energy and risk that is taken on a daily basis to acquire bitcoins by participating in an open and free market for transaction validation and ordering that ensures that individuals who are so motivated have access to an open and permissionless monetary system with a hard capped supply and no trusted third parties is mind boggling. The most impressive part of this feat is that it materialized in a completely emergent and grassroots fashion. Sure, there are massive corporations that now exist with the sole intent of mining bitcoin at massive scales, but the path to this point was paved by a collective of individuals who plugged computers in, ran some software that enabled them to mine bitcoin, noticed inefficiencies and ways they could turn them into efficiencies, and built a multi-billion dollar industry to achieve those efficiencies.\n\nThe breadth of the bitcoin mining landscape spans from bookcases housing [Bitaxes](https://bitaxe.org/?ref=tftc.io) to gigawatt scale data centers participating in demand response programs to help balance the most important energy infrastructure that we depend on every day; grids. It's a beautiful thing.\n\nAnother thing that this milestone screams to me is just how resilient the bitcoin network is. For those who have forgotten, the Chinese government banned bitcoin mining in the Spring/Summer of 2021. As a result, the network hashrate fell by more than 50% from ~170 EH/s to ~83 EH/s.\n\n[![The Bitcoin Network Just Reached An Insane Mining Milestone](https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-10.32.50---PM.png)](https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/hashrate-difficulty?ref=tftc.io#all)\n\nvia [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/hashrate-difficulty?ref=tftc.io#all)\n\nIn just over 4 years hashrate has not only recovered from the post-China ban lows, it has increased by **12.3x**. Simply remarkable. This is where the signal is today. Mining is the heartbeat of the bitcoin network. All of the miners producing 1 sextillion hashes per second exist to aggregate valid transactions in blocks and add them to the ledger every ten minutes on average. Individually dealing with infrastructure costs, execution risks, unknown competitors entering the market and pushing hashrate up, beholden to the whims of bitcoin price volatility and (funnily enough) the weather.\n\nBitcoin is doing just fine. Don't let anyone tell you differently.\n\n### The Deliberate Middle Class Destruction\n\nTom Luongo revealed how banking regulations systematically prevent middle-class Americans from building wealth through homeownership. He explained that Dodd-Frank and Elizabeth Warren's CFPB created barriers making it nearly impossible for small business owners to access mortgages, even with strong incomes.

Such growth in only nine months highlights the widespread discontent regarding the handling of OP\\_RETURN.\n\nBitcoin Knots allows operators to maintain strict limits on data size, a feature supporters consider essential to preserving the core characteristics of the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nThe issue remains unresolved: on one side, Bitcoin Core developers advocate for greater flexibility in the use of the timechain; on the other, a significant portion of the community prefers to maintain restrictions to safeguard the monetary use of the network.\n\nThe post [Jimmy Song slams Bitcoin Core devs for “fiat” approach to OP\\_RETURN](https://atlas21.com/jimmy-song-slams-bitcoin-core-devs-for-fiat-approach-to-op_return/) appeared first on [Atlas21](https://atlas21.com).","sig":"4dce5175ee01b422cb3e7574d097b4736de794c4b787ad50b97cf71906ba54a74c8afc7d934baab01c452b25b04be492422a6e4a54fafe83acef703b2a056c82"}

However, the critical economic situation pushed the government to reconsider its stance, lifting the long-standing ban on digital assets and [authorizing](https://atlas21.com/bolivia-reverses-course-banks-open-up-to-cryptocurrencies/) banks to process Bitcoin and stablecoin transactions.\n\nThe first sign of this shift came in March, when the state-owned oil and gas company **Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos** received government approval to accept cryptocurrencies for fuel imports, as a solution to the growing U.S. dollar shortage.\n\n### **Foreign reserves crisis**\n\n[Data](https://tradingeconomics.com/bolivia/foreign-exchange-reserves) from Trading Economics paint a worrying picture: Bolivia’s foreign currency reserves have collapsed by **98%,** dropping from **$12.7 billion** in July 2014 to just **$171 million** in August of this year. This collapse has led citizens and businesses to seek more stable alternatives to the local currency.\n\nFears of losing purchasing power in the national currency have pushed many Bolivians to favor the U.S. dollar or, increasingly, stablecoins. The country’s main bank described digital assets as _“a reliable and viable alternative”_ to traditional currencies.\n\nRetailers in Bolivian airports have begun pricing essential products in USDT as a strategy to navigate the currency crisis.\n\n**Gabriel Campa**, TowerBank’s head of digital assets, [explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN8WctPQ4PI) to Bitfinex how Bolivian import businesses are using USDT to bypass the U.S. dollar shortage. The process involves purchasing stablecoins locally or via offshore bank accounts, converting them into U.S. dollars to pay foreign suppliers, and then determining the product prices in USDT.\n\nThe post [Bolivia: Toyota, Yamaha, and BYD accept USDT to tackle dollar shortage](https://atlas21.com/bolivia-toyota-yamaha-and-byd-accept-usdt-to-tackle-dollar-shortage/) appeared first on [Atlas21](https://atlas21.com).","sig":"007fc3ce19d07682de85694d4ce24a66c0827b9a28f8e00cffaa4fc30f782c4c3fe5d285ef1c9d8fe20763b8e9290a7372c700a1861b2332bf1278d3cd2aeac3"}

We don’t have royals in Bitcoin and we routinely slay our heroes, which means that anybody who sticks around for a long time has Lindy-proven integrity. Svanholm is one such character: If you’ve attended the conference circuit in recent years, you’re likely to have encountered Svanholm’s enchanting voice and scruffy beard — cowboy hat included for fashion and good measure. I’ve always had a weak spot for this fellow Scandinavian, whether it be his uncompromising words or impressive output, his funky demeanor or funny personality. In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine, we chatted about publishing books in the modern age, writing, praxeology — the arcane science underpinning Austrian economics — spirituality, nation-states, the cooperative nature of Bitcoin, how Bitcoin wins and why leaning into “the fun” makes for a better path to the brilliant, bright, orange future we both see. Together with his sidekick and co-author Luke de Wolf, Svanholm has incorporated the publishing house Lemiscate Media in Estonia, which allowed them to accept sats and keep bitcoin on the balance sheet — a bitcoin treasury company, the old-fashioned way. It also offered a convenient way around Amazon’s book publishing gatekeeping and meant that all books became print-on-demand. (All of Knut Svanholm’s previous book — including “Everything Divided by 21 Million” and “The Inverse of Clown World” — are available via Lemiscate.) JB: Knut, tell me about your publishing company. Are you trying to copy Saifedean Ammous and make Lemiscate Media be like his The Saif House? Knut: Yeah, I’ve always been a little bit Saifedean-like, or rather: Saif with a pirate hat. But it’s not because I’m copying Saif on purpose, but rather that things have just played out this way… There’s a reason why that happens. The same thing happened with my book “Praxeology: The Invisible Hand That Feeds You” — I re-wrote it this year and turned it into a full course for Plan ₿ that’ll be released this winter. It was all a very Saifedean-like approach, echoing what he did with his “Principles of Economics” textbook. Mine is much less dense: The chapters are shorter and a bit more accessible than in Saif’s book. JB: One question I had for us sitting down was about your book “Praxeology,” your attempt to connect Bitcoiners with Austrian economists. When it came out, I saw almost nobody writing about it (I did!) — what happened? “Everything Divided by 21 Million,” massive success; “Praxeology,” almost nothing. What gives? Knut: Generally speaking, I think people read less and it’s hard to follow up on a hit. Plus, there are a little too many Bitcoin books right now as well; people don’t know what to choose. The more long-term goal here is to assemble all of the books into one, a “collected volumes” type of thing, leatherbound etc. The podcast I run with Luke de Wolf, Bitcoin Infinity Show, is more for hardened Bitcoiners — conviction-deepening rather than orange-pilling… JB: …then why are you clowning about so much on the show? Knut: Haha… it doesn’t matter what you do, the absolute most important thing is that what you deliver is entertaining in some way. That can be because it’s interesting or because it’s passionate — or because it’s fun! And fun can be a shortcut to entertaining: If it’s fun, people stick around. If you keep your humor about, that becomes a tool for making people listen. We think about this when it comes to Satoshi Rockamoto [the pop-up concert events that Svanholm runs together with Mike Jarmuz, Samson Mow, Martti Malmi etc., eds. remark]. It started way back, at an event in Mexico and we all just borrowed some instruments and were all surprised at how good it sounded… Wouldn’t it be a good idea to do this at different conferences?! JB: Yeah, those shows are amazing, and you can really tell that you guys are having fun. Is it all planned and rehearsed, or do you guys just wing it? Knut: No, it’s completely improvised. This time in Helsinki at BTCHel was the first time we rehearsed together — once. I often gotta pinch myself… Am I really in a band with Martii Malmi and Samson Mow?! What everyone who is anyone in Bitcoin have in common is that they’re just themselves, and that just works. Good times at #btchel #rockamoto with @knutsvanholm @lukedewolf @JoeNakamoto @giacomozucco and many others. Thanks to all the event organizers, and to @SwissHodler and @Jake21m for videography! pic.twitter.com/T46CJCeLkb — Martti Malmi (@marttimalmi) August 17, 2025 Knut: I’m trying to live by my words, practice what I preach… and I’ve long had this idea that we are our satoshis. JB: I remember the first time I heard you say that, on stage in Prague 2023 — and you just looked completely out of your mind! Knut: The entire distinction between satoshis and personhood is pretty blurry: All there is to Bitcoin is keeping a secret from someone else… All nodes, all miners, etc., have a person behind them. They’re not “backed by energy,” but by human action (…which, technically, is also backed by energy). At the end of the day, I always say that Bitcoin is an agreement on a fixed set of rules, and the reason we agree on this specific set of rules is that they are costlier to try to break than to just follow. And that’s what allows for resistance, irreplicability and finiteness. JB: There’s a quote in economics and game theory to the effect of “trading is cheaper than raiding,” but still world history is littered with wars. What do you make of that? Knut: Yes, but if the aggressor thinks that he has enough to profit from violence, there’s a risk he will. Where Bitcoin is different is that I can threaten you with a gun — Joakim, give me all of your sats! — but there is no way for me to know how many sats you have. So game-theoretically, it’s better for me to offer you something of value and trade with you… Bitcoin has moved the point at which aggression pays further out, and this aspect of Bitcoin is so underappreciated. But let’s return to this idea that we are all our satoshis. Everybody wants to pump their bags, and we all benefit from number-go-up, which means all companies and everybody in Bitcoin have an incentive to help each other. With Lemiscate and Bitcoin Infinity Show we’re really trying to put that in practice right now, by giving as much as we can because, in the end, it all comes back to us! Why not cooperate? Take Vexl, the peer-to-peer trading platform out of Prague; they’re not paying us a dime to say this, but I still want everyone to be on Vexl — it’s an excellent service. Bitcoin jobs in general is so completely different than fiat jobs; you don’t even need to, or can expect, to be paid anything to begin with. Rather, you must provide value first and then reap rewards later. That’s so powerful, and most people don’t get that: All I want is for you to flourish. JB: The connection to Praxeology is so obvious: We’ve sort of fiat-ized what “work” is. A job is: you’re employed by someone, you do something and you’re paid by the hour… And there are laws around this, it’s your right as a laborer to receive this money. And nobody thinks about how working is about creating value for someone else. Knut: And that doesn’t stop being true just because someone — the state, labor unions — is trying hard to make that not true. Still, an employer won’t hire anybody if it’s too costly. Say you want to hire somebody in Sweden. Then you have to consider that you can’t fire them very easily, you gotta pay payroll taxes, and income taxes etc., if they’re ill, you have to pay for their recovery, and blah-blah-blah. It leads to this entitlement idea, a culture or I deserve all this. Most people don’t understand how Bitcoin is different here: What happens when there is a way to signal value that’s deflationary, absolutely finite, such that all prices — including salaries — fall over time, while purchasing power rises. If you hire someone, and that someone gets the same amount of satoshis every month, their real salary is effectively increasing… You never need to readjust salaries. Micropayments is such a fiat idea… The entire model of velocity of money is a Keynesian idea.. I think subscription models will increase in popularity. On a deflationary standard, a company has every incentive to receive one larger payment early over many smaller payments later, because it will receive fewer and fewer satoshis every time. JB: Uh, ok… Knut: I think people just underestimate what deflation is. That’s the main thesis in “The Inverse of Clown World”: Everything that’s true in fiat, the inverse of that is true in Bitcoin. On a bitcoin standard, we’ll have fewer transactions — not more. It’s a pet theory I have, and it was in a Bitcoin Magazine article (“The Real Scaling Solution for Bitcoin”) a few years ago: With a richer society, you’ll have fewer transactions. Say ten rich people and ten poor people are having dinner. Among the rich people, at the end of the night, someone picks up the tab, so over time there’ll be ten transactions — one per dinner. But for the poor people, who don’t have enough wealth, everyone has to pay for their own meal on every occasion, meaning a hundred transactions. If we focus on quality instead of quantity, which is what happens in a deflationary economy, what happens is fewer transactions but more significant, valuable transactions. “Will give everyone a reason to save rather than overconsume, giving more people access to whatever they want over time because of the falling prices. If you postpone your spending, your bitcoin will buy you more in the future. In other words, fewer transactions. Quality before quantity. The necessity for transactions per second will diminish.” This article really didn’t pull any punches. In a hundred years, you won’t pay for coffee anymore; the barista will give it to you for free, since he has built up this entire chain of trust over generations, which will ensure that you want to give him something of value. JB: Like that quote you referred to on stage here at BTCHel, know-your-customer laws are economically illiterate; trust is the opposite of money. Trading partners only need to use money when they don’t trust someone. The difference is, you use credit money with those you trust, and commodity money with strangers. Knut: Precisely! You only need money in trade when you don’t trust the people you’re trading with. That’s the problem with credit money altogether: It isn’t money. Even if you have debt notes or credit money, it has to be denominated in something — and that something is what constitutes money. My man Dr. @IoniAppelberg killing it at @btchelevent pic.twitter.com/xX7tOUyQNF — Knut Svanholm ∞/21M (@knutsvanholm) August 16, 2025 I learned this in Murray Rothbard’s excellent book “What Has Government Done to Our Money?” There’s no doubt about it: Credit money is not money. Money represents something valuable; even if that’s a debt, it has to be denominated in something — and it’s that thing that is money. When you accept a receipt for something and you don’t receive the thing back, that’s theft. And that’s what banknotes are. JB: You write something to that effect in the beginning of your 2020 book “Independence Reimagined”, about how collective imagination is one of our greatest strengths as humans — but also our worst weakness. Natural law, property rights, money etc, aren’t out there, in nature, right; we don’t discover them, but invent them, no…? Knut: No, all the way down to molecular biology or complex societies like ant hills, I think, where we find examples of what looks like cooperation and herd behavior, but in reality, you’re backstabbing them — the black sheep of the herd, etc. What’s evolutionarily good for the herd isn’t always the same as what’s good for the herd. JB: This is something monetary scholars often talk about, what is it that money does in a society? Large-scale cooperation, overcoming Dunbar’s number etc. It’s these collective delusions that let a billion Catholics cooperate, or 330 million Americans to all believe in their shared stories — not that America is doing extraordinarily well, but that’s beside the point — the belief that we are one unit is what lets us cooperate so we’ll create bigger things. Knut: Organized religion and, after that, nation-states, might be good for your tribe, for convincing people that they go to heaven if you murder members of this other tribe. And to do that, we have to cooperate, so we need to tax citizens this or that much and then demand that you give your life for the herd. That’s rarely good for the individual soldier. And some of these units have created pretty destructive things, too. For some of these topics — like the question of God — I’m perfectly comfortable not knowing certain things, if I know these are questions we can’t answer. If you were to order the great Austrians in order of religiosity, I think we’d get Mises -> Rothbard -> Hoppe. What I’ve changed my mind about is that I nowadays believe democracy to be the most dangerous religion. It’s better that people believe in a fake friend in the sky than an earthly friend who swindles them. Religion is a tool for managed control, the best way to fool 18-year-olds into war — and psychopaths will use it! JB: What’s the connection to economics or praxeology? Knut: Well, economic thought was actually better before the Enlightenment than after. At that time, all economists were also theologians grappling with the basic question, What does God want? Many of them are opposed to the phenomenon of interest, unethical practices and turning people into debt slaves JB: … like Jeff Booth said in his lecture at BTCHel “No They. Only We”… Knut: Precisely, and it’s not until we get Austrian economics that we actually can explain how interest is ethical — That it’s just the price of tomorrow, to quote Booth. And prices and interest rates fall in a free market. JB: Everything we talk about here is so in the weeds, so deep, so spiritual. Praxeology itself is a bit like that, making us wonder what in the world is this thing we call consciousness, choice, economics? Knut: The basic tenet is that science cannot derive an ought from an is — but with praxeology, we can get pretty darn close! Hans-Hermann Hoppe explains it best, but if I were to try, I’d say, “All communications and interaction between humans are the result of some sort of conflict.” We perceive value in communicating rather than attacking, which means all language is for resolving conflict; we have human language so that we can comprehend one another. From there, you’re very close to absolute property rights. And here’s argumentation ethics: If I say every human owns their own bodies, you cannot rebuke that without proving my point. And from there, we can derive so much knowledge from that, if you only accept those axioms. But they are still pretty darn sound axioms. JB: So why isn’t this sexy? Why doesn’t it sell? I think this is, big-brain gigachad boom stuff… but nobody cares. Knut: …and it’s so goddamn simple that it’s better to cooperate than to use violence. People don’t understand how much they’re being robbed today; everybody underestimates their own value. It’s tragic, but not that hard to explain: You have an institution — public school — entirely funded by theft. You learn math and English and whatever, but you also learn social science, which is nothing but opinions and bullshit. We’re taught obedience rather than providing value. Everything that at some level is supported by government money is corrupt and unethical. These ideas have existed for centuries, but it’s so hard for normies to get past this: If there’s one thing public education shoves down our throats more than anything else, it’s that democracy is the most important and most beautiful thing we have. It’s not. It’s a system that says, because of a popularity contest, you have the right to take others’ stuff; it’s completely wrong, beginning to end. JB: How do you see this fixed? How do we win? Knut: The more we use bitcoin, KYC-free, between each other without paying taxes, and without inflation, the more we disarm the psychopaths. JB: Very, very slowly, one person at a time? Knut: Yes: Sooner or later, everyone wakes up to this. Anyone who attends these Bitcoin conferences can see for themselves how freakin’ superior bitcoin is to fiat money. JB: We went on a Bitcoin Walk in Helsinki yesterday. We stopped at a café — cute, small, two people working there, and 50 Bitcoiners show up. Obviously, everyone was gonna try to orange-pill this poor barista: wallets, zapping, the whole ordeal. Just think about it for a minute, 50 people, 5,000-10,000 sats zapped each, that’s a good couple of hundred bucks. Easy money, right? No, the dude had zero interest; he just wanted to serve coffee and get on with his day. Knut: Well, at dinner last night, we met a server who was exactly the other way around. She was super interested, “Oh yes, I’ve heard about bitcoin but I’ve never tried it, don’t know how it works.” From just a handful of us, she got some $50 — super happy about it! JB: So the guy we met yesterday just didn’t have curiosity awakened yet, whereas your server from last night did…? You think that’s the difference? Knut: Yes! The biggest reason for this is that to even grasp what Bitcoin is or what it does, you need to spend 100 hours on self-education… and most people aren’t willing to do that! The biggest hurdle to adoption is that people don’t have time; they don’t have 10,000 hours or whatever to invest into Bitcoin in order to fully understand it. JB: But we do have that time — certainly in a country like Finland. At least in the West, we work fewer hours, we have higher real wages, more leisure time. You can devote your time to whatever. Knut: Sure, but most people want to go to work, then go home and feel like they made a living for themselves when actually they worked three out of five days for the government, and another for the banks. That we still have money and time left is a testament to how strong the free market is: Everything good in the world comes from the free market. It’s a more powerful force than any totalitarian, self-pompos leader ever could be. Despite democracy, taxes and inflation, things move forward. We have progress. JB: Alright, wrapping up. What gives you hope? Where do you see the light? I don’t think the future is dark — it’s bright af — but the more you look out into fiatland, the worse things look. Knut: That’s because the future isn’t in fiat — it’s in Bitcoin. The future is bitcoin. It’s definitely this “Which Way, Western Man” meme. Either we’re in a world where everyone cooperates — like Booth says, eight billion people in service of eight billion people — or we’re going further down totalitarian oppression, darker and darker. If we didn’t have Bitcoin, I’d be much less hopeful for the future. Bitcoin exists, it’s easy to learn, and when a system is better, people make the change — put like that, why wouldn’t Bitcoin win? The world with Bitcoin is beautiful.

But it’s not because I’m copying Saif on purpose, but rather that things have just played out this way… There’s a reason why that happens. The same thing happened with my book “[Praxeology: The Invisible Hand That Feeds You](https://www.amazon.com/Praxeology-Invisible-Hand-that-Feeds/dp/991692175X)” — I re-wrote it this year and turned it into a full course for [Plan ₿](https://planb.network/en/professor/knut-svanholm-896106ba-dcbf-406f-8d8a-b2e6581a2381) that’ll be released this winter. It was all a very Saifedean-like approach, echoing what he did with his “Principles of Economics” textbook. Mine is much less dense: The chapters are shorter and a bit more accessible than in Saif’s book. \n\n![](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-67-640x1024.png \"Bitcoin Gives Me Hope, Says Knut Svanholm in Bitcoin Magazine Exclusive Interview 2\")\n\n**JB:** One question I had for us sitting down was about your book “Praxeology,” your attempt to connect [Bitcoiners with Austrian economists](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-austrian-economics-1409113330). When it came out, I saw almost nobody writing about it ([I did!](https://mises.org/mises-wire/private-property-comes-scarcity-not-law)) — what happened? “[Everything Divided by 21 Million](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Everything-divided-21-million/dp/9916697191),” massive success; “Praxeology,” almost nothing. What gives?\n\n**Knut:** Generally speaking, I think people read less and it’s hard to follow up on a hit. Plus, there are a little too many Bitcoin books right now as well; people don’t know what to choose. The more long-term goal here is to assemble _all_ of the books into one, a “collected volumes” type of thing, leatherbound etc. The podcast I run with Luke de Wolf, [Bitcoin Infinity Show](https://www.bitcoininfinityshow.com/), is more for hardened Bitcoiners — conviction-deepening rather than [orange-pilling](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/no-one-person-orange-pilled-you)… \n\n**JB**: …then why are you clowning about so much on the show?\n\n**Knut**: Haha… it doesn’t matter what you do, the absolute most important thing is that what you deliver is entertaining in some way. That can be because it’s interesting or because it’s passionate — or because it’s fun! And fun can be a shortcut to entertaining: If it’s fun, people stick around. If you keep your humor about, that becomes a tool for making people listen. We think about this when it comes to [Satoshi Rockamoto](https://x.com/btchelevent/status/1952421273058845183) \\[the pop-up [concert events](https://btchel.com/side-events/) that Svanholm runs together with Mike Jarmuz, Samson Mow, Martti Malmi etc., eds. remark\\]. It started way back, at an event in Mexico and we all just borrowed some instruments and were all surprised at how good it sounded… Wouldn’t it be a good idea to do this at different conferences?!\n\n**JB**: Yeah, those shows are amazing, and you can really tell that you guys are having fun. Is it all planned and rehearsed, or do you guys just wing it?\n\n**Knut**: No, it’s completely improvised. This time in [Helsinki at BTCHel](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/bitcoin-conference-btchelsinki) was the first time we rehearsed together — _once_. I often gotta pinch myself… _Am I really in a band with Martii Malmi and Samson Mow?!_ What everyone who is anyone in Bitcoin have in common is that they’re just themselves, and that just works. \n\n> Good times at [#btchel](https://twitter.com/hashtag/btchel?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#rockamoto](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rockamoto?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) with [@knutsvanholm](https://twitter.com/knutsvanholm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@lukedewolf](https://twitter.com/lukedewolf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@JoeNakamoto](https://twitter.com/JoeNakamoto?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@giacomozucco](https://twitter.com/giacomozucco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and many others.

They’re not “backed by energy,” but by human action (…which, technically, is also backed by energy). At the end of the day, I always say that _Bitcoin is an agreement on a fixed set of rules_, and the reason we agree on _this_ specific set of rules is that they are costlier to try to break than to just follow. And that’s what allows for resistance, irreplicability and finiteness. \n\n**JB**: There’s a quote in economics and game theory to the effect of “trading is cheaper than raiding,” but still world history is littered with wars. What do you make of that?\n\n**Knut:** Yes, but if the aggressor thinks that he has enough to profit from violence, there’s a risk he will. Where Bitcoin is different is that I can threaten you with a gun — _Joakim, give me all of your sats!_ — but there is no way for me to know how many sats you have. So game-theoretically, it’s better for me to offer you something of value and trade with you… Bitcoin has moved the point at which aggression pays further out, and this aspect of Bitcoin is so underappreciated.\n\nBut let’s return to this idea that we are all our satoshis. Everybody wants to pump their bags, and we all benefit from [number-go-up](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-a-trojan-horse-for-freedom), which means all companies and everybody in Bitcoin have an incentive to help each other. \n\nWith Lemiscate and Bitcoin Infinity Show we’re really trying to put that in practice right now, by giving as much as we can because, in the end, it all comes back to us! Why not cooperate? Take [Vexl](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/vexl-the-next-generation-bitcoin-p2p-trading-app), the [peer-to-peer trading platform](https://vexl.it/) out of Prague; they’re not paying us a dime to say this, but I still want everyone to be on Vexl — it’s an excellent service. \n\nBitcoin jobs in general is so completely different than fiat jobs; you don’t even need to, or can expect, to be paid anything to begin with. Rather, you must provide value first and then reap rewards later. That’s _so_ powerful, and most people don’t get that: All I want is for _you_ to flourish. \n\n**JB:** The connection to Praxeology is _so_ obvious: We’ve sort of fiat-ized what “work” is. A job is","sig":"eeb2708ea9b16e29fe59667a1bd8b4493eff7112d7ce53a79f438437bd452cd89ad825a6d90dfdb7dd92730105fea2627936b19da4e347779e6113714010042e"}

Independent Whitepapers, peer reviewed papers, sustainability media companies, mainstream media and specialists in the field of grid operations, energy and renewable generation have all endorsed Bitcoin mining’s growing list of environmental benefits. This is quite a turnaround from 2021, when it was not uncommon for people to believe that Bitcoin mining was bad for the environment, a sentiment that was reinforced by the type of reporting that was done at that time. Bitcoin mining it seems is following the same trend as other disruptive technologies including the Bicycle, The Radio and The Internet, who received negative coverage for a period of time, which then improved as people came to better understand the utility of the technology. The phases that greet disruptive technologies are : phase 1: negative first impressions dominate phase 2: better understanding and mixed reports phase 3: initial negative assessments have been debunked, and positive externalities are not only better understood, but evidenced with real world examples. This article documents Bitcoin coverage and studies from: Independent reports (87.5% show strong environmental benefits) Mainstream media reporting (88.9% highlight Bitcoin’s environmental benefits) Sustainable media reporting (91.1% highlight Bitcoin’s environmental benefits) Peer reviewed articles (80% show strong environmental benefits) which collectively show evidence that Bitcoin has just entered phase three.

Well, it looks like FinCen and the Treasury have been working on guidelines and a rough outline is shared above courtesy of The Rage, and they are absolutely horrid.\n\nIt seems that FinCen and the Treasury are preparing to outlaw the use of CoinJoin, atomic swaps, single address use, and transaction broadcast timing delays. All of which are common **best use** practices that I would recommend any bitcoiner leveraging self-custody practice. This is an all out attack on financial privacy within bitcoin. If enacted, any user who leverages these tools will be flagged as a suspicious, any attempts to send a UTXO that has touched any of these tools will be rejected by regulated services, and could potentially be sent to prison.\n\nThis is an absurd affront to common sensibilities and freedom in the digital age. The fact that they want to prevent people from using single addresses for individual UTXOs is patently absurd. Not only is it a massive infringement on privacy, but it makes bitcoin usage less economically efficient and degrades the security of every bitcoiner. Loading up a single address with too many UTXOs degrades the entropy of a public-private key pair and makes it easier to brute force a user's private key.\n\nInstead of expanding the Patriot Act, it should be abolished. Instead of trying to eliminate financial privacy for the 99.9% of law abiding citizens in this country, the government should be actively trying to foster an environment in which it can be improved. The proposed solutions will do nothing but put good Americans in harm's way and degrade the security of their savings.\n\nWe shouldn't have to live in a world where standards cater to the lowest common denominator, in this case criminals, and make things worse off for the overwhelming majority of the population. It's crazy that this even has to be said. The onus is on law enforcement to be so good at their jobs that they are able to prevent crimes from happening before they occur and effectively bring criminals to heel after they commit crimes. It shouldn't be on a neutral protocol and the industry being built on top of it that, when used effectively, provides people with a stable monetary system that respects user privacy and equips them with the tools to receive and spend in a way that provides them with peace of mind.\n\nWhy should everyone have to suffer because of a few bad apples? Isn't that letting the terrorist win?\n\n### Bitcoin Is Becoming Less Volatile as It Integrates Into Traditional Finance Infrastructure\n\nMel Mattison revealed a fascinating shift in Bitcoin's market dynamics that challenges conventional crypto wisdom. He pointed out that Bitcoin futures now exhibit lower volatility than platinum futures - a remarkable transformation for an asset once synonymous with wild price swings. The proliferation of ETFs, options, futures, and other traditional financial instruments has fundamentally altered Bitcoin's behavior, creating what Mel calls \"volatility suppression.\" This institutionalization comes with trade-offs: while reducing dramatic downswings, it also caps explosive upside potential.\n\n> \"Bitcoin is becoming a TradFi security instrument and it's getting TradFi vol.\" - [Mel Mattison](https://x.com/MelMattison1?ref=tftc.io)\n\nMel argued that the relationship between volatility and returns means investors must recalibrate expectations. Where 100% annual gains once seemed routine, he now considers 50% returns \"massive\" for this new era of Bitcoin. This maturation reflects Bitcoin's evolution from speculative experiment to financial infrastructure - less exciting perhaps, but ultimately more sustainable for long-term adoption.\n\nCheck out the [full podcast here](https://youtu.be/QEyxOwaQFzo?ref=tftc.io) for more on China's gold strategy, Fed independence battles, and housing market manipulation plans.\n\n* * *\n\n### Headlines of the Day\n\nNew Bill for Strategic Bitcoin Reserve - via [X](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1965148899565600991?ref=tftc.io)\n\nSEC to Host Crypto Roundtable October 17 - via [X](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1965140430838006076?ref=tftc.io)\n\nResearch Proposes Bitcoin for Mars Trade Standard - via [X](https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1965135337543664112?ref=tftc.io)\n\n* * *\n\n### Secure Your Bitcoin The Hard Way\n\nTom Honzik has helped 1,000+ people secure more than 5,000 BTC.

It benefits everyone if our energy infrastructure is as efficient and robust as possible. Unfortunately, broken incentives have led to increased regulation throughout the sector, incentivizing less efficient energy sources such as solar and wind at the detriment of more efficient alternatives.\n\nThe result has been less reliable energy infrastructure for all Americans and increased energy costs across the board. This naturally has a direct impact on bitcoin miners: increased energy costs make them less competitive globally.\n\nBitcoin mining represents a global energy market that does not require permission to participate. Anyone can plug a mining computer into power and internet to get paid the current dynamic market price for their work in bitcoin. Using cellphone or satellite internet, these mines can be located anywhere in the world, sourcing the cheapest power available.  \n  \nAbsent of regulation, bitcoin mining naturally incentivizes the build out of highly efficient and robust energy infrastructure. Unfortunately that world does not exist and burdensome regulations remain the biggest threat for US based mining businesses. Jurisdictional arbitrage gives miners the option of moving to a friendlier country but that naturally comes with its own costs.  \n  \nEnter AI. With the rapid development and release of AI tools comes the requirement of running massive datacenters for their models. Major tech companies are scrambling to secure machines, rack space, and cheap energy to run full suites of AI enabled tools and services. **The most valuable and powerful tech companies in America have stumbled into an accidental alliance with bitcoin miners: THE NEED FOR CHEAP AND RELIABLE ENERGY.**\n\nOur government is corrupt.

Instead, it allows investors to get exposure to bitcoin through futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nFutures ETFs generally get regulatory approvals more easily, as they do not hold any funds.\n\nWhat’s special about this fund is that it has foreign exchange (FX) risk hedging, so the impact of USD/PLN fluctuations on investor returns is reduced.\n\n_“The ETF gives investors exposure to the cryptocurrency market in regulated trading on the stock exchange,”_ said GPW.\n\nThe ETF is designed to meet the growing demand from institutional and retail investors looking for a safe and regulated way to invest in bitcoin.\n\nAlthough futures ETFs tend to underperform spot over time, they still provide a means of getting exposure to bitcoin without the need for digital wallets or unregulated platforms.\n\nMichał Kobza, member of the GPW Management Board, emphasized the benefits:\n\n> _“Offering exposure to Bitcoin through an ETF listed on GPW increases safety of trading as investors can participate in the cryptocurrency market using an instrument which is supervised, cleared, and subject to the transparency standards applicable to a regulated capital market.”_\n\nLiquidity for the fund is provided by Dom Maklerski Banku Ochrony Środowiska S.A. (BOŚ), a Polish brokerage acting as market maker. So investors can buy and sell the ETF without worrying about big price gaps.\n\nThe Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) approved the ETF prospectus on June 17, 2025. Now AgioFunds can issue Series A and B investment certificates and the ETF can be listed on GPW.\n\nKazimierz Szpak, CEO of BETA TFI SA and manager of the BETA ETF brand at AgioFunds, said:\n\n_“The ETF is our response to the growing demand from investors for new asset classes. I believe that the Bitcoin BETA ETF will meet market expectations and will be welcomed by investors.”_\n\nThe Bitcoin BETA ETF brings the total number of ETFs on GPW to 16.\n\nThere are funds tracking Polish indices like WIG20, mWIG40 and sWIG80, as well as international benchmarks like S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, and DAX. Sector ETFs, leveraged products, and inverse ETFs are also available.\n\nETFs are gaining popularity in Poland. According to GPW data, ETF turnover has already reached PLN 1.9 billion this year, which is 94% more than in the same period last year.\n\nPoland follows the global trend of Bitcoin-based investment products. Canada had its first bitcoin ETFs in 2021, and the U.S. in 2024.

These plants emit significant amounts of CO2, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter, disproportionately impacting low-income communities near their locations. While there is broad consensus on the need to phase them out, progress has stalled. Surprisingly, a key barrier comes from an unexpected source: ideologically driven environmental NGOs. Despite advocating for cleaner energy, these groups have often opposed pragmatic solutions to reduce peaker plant reliance. By dismissing collaborations with utilities and energy companies as “greenwashing” outright, and refusing to engage with transitional technologies, they inadvertently prolong the lifespan of these polluting facilities. The Problem with “All or Nothing” Activism Many environmental NGOs operate under a rigid ideological framework that rejects any solution involving fossil fuel infrastructure, even if it demonstrably reduces emissions in the short term. This stance has led to the dismissal of viable bridge technologies, such as: Retrofitting Peaker Plants with Carbon Capture or Efficiency Upgrades In 2021, Duke Energy proposed retrofitting gas peaker plants in North Carolina with carbon capture systems and hybrid natural gas-battery systems to cut emissions by 50%. However, the Sierra Club and Sunrise Movement labeled the plan a “false climate solution,” arguing it legitimized fossil fuels. The project was shelved, leaving older, higher-emitting peakers in operation (source: Duke Energy Sustainability Report, 2022). Renewable-Natural Gas Hybrid Projects In California, where peaker plants contribute to poor air quality, startups like Mote Hydrogen sought to convert peakers to run on hydrogen-blended natural gas. While this would reduce NOx emissions by 30%, NGOs like 350.org criticized the effort as a “distraction from true renewables,” despite the lack of large-scale battery storage to replace peakers entirely (source: California Air Resources Board, 2023). These examples highlight a pattern: NGOs frequently attack projects that could meaningfully reduce emissions while offering no scalable alternatives. The result? Utilities default to maintaining outdated peaker plants rather than risk reputational damage from NGO backlash. Criticism Without Grid-Scale Alternatives The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that even in net-zero scenarios, natural gas will supply 15% of global electricity by 2040 due to grid stability needs (source: IEA World Energy Outlook, 2022). Transitioning away from peaker plants requires bridging solutions, yet NGOs often reject these outright. For instance, when NextEra Energy proposed replacing Florida peaker plants with solar farms paired with gas turbines (to ensure reliability during cloudy periods), the Center for Biological Diversity accused the utility of “greenwashing fossil fuel dependence.” No alternative plan was put forward, leaving aging peakers operational (source: Tampa Bay Times, 2021). Similarly, in New York, the closure of the Astoria peaker plant was delayed after local NGOs opposed a replacement facility using lower-emission turbines, demanding immediate 100% renewables—a goal the grid couldn’t yet support (source: NYISO Reliability Report, 2022). This absolutism ignores grid realities. Battery storage remains costly and limited in duration, leaving peaker plants as a necessary backstop. By blocking incremental improvements, NGOs ensure dirtier status-quo operations persist. Bitcoin Mining: A Pragmatic Alternative to Gas Peaker Plants in Texas While gas peaker plants have long been the default solution for grid stability during peak demand, Bitcoin mining has emerged as a scalable, cost-effective, and environmentally superior alternative—particularly in Texas. By acting as a flexible demand-side resource, Bitcoin mining has already demonstrated its ability to reduce reliance on peaker plants, even as ideologically driven NGOs and fossil fuel interests continue to oppose it. How Bitcoin Mining Replaces Gas Peaker Plants Gas peaker plants are designed to activate only during periods of extreme electricity demand, typically running fewer than 1,500 hours annually. However, their high costs, methane emissions, and environmental harms make them a poor long-term solution. Bitcoin mining, by contrast, provides grid operators with a unique tool: the ability to rapidly curtail energy consumption during peak demand, stabilizing the grid without the need for additional fossil fuel infrastructure. In Texas, this approach was pioneered by ERCOT CEO Brad Jones following the catastrophic 2021 Winter Storm Uri, which exposed the fragility of relying solely on peaker plants. Jones recognized that Bitcoin miners—unlike traditional industrial loads—could shut down operations within seconds, freeing up gigawatts of power for critical needs during emergencies. This flexibility allowed ERCOT to: Avoid building 3 GW of new gas peaker plants proposed by Berkshire Hathaway Energy, saving Texans an estimated $18 billion in infrastructure costs. Integrate more renewables by providing a “buyer of last resort” for excess solar and wind energy, which incentivizes renewable development. Reduce emissions by displacing peaker plants, which emit 0.4–0.6 tons of CO2 per MWh and leak methane even while idling. Peer-reviewed studies validate this strategy. Bruno et al. (2023) found that Bitcoin mining with demand response eliminated the need for gas peaker plants entirely while reducing annual carbon emissions by 48.67 million metric tons compared to baseline scenarios (Table 1). Rhodes et al. (2024) further concluded that Bitcoin mining’s flexibility enables grids to prioritize renewable energy over fossil fuels, accelerating decarbonization. Texas: A Proof of Concept By 2024, Bitcoin mining operations in Texas had grown to 3 GW of flexible load capacity, participating actively in ERCOT’s demand response programs. This resource proved critical during extreme weather events, such as the July 2023 heatwave, when miners voluntarily powered down to free up 1.2 GW of electricity—equivalent to the output of three large peaker plants. ERCOT has since reported zero blackouts despite record demand, crediting Bitcoin mining as a key factor in grid resilience. Dr Rian Dewhurst, of the Digital Assets Research Institute explains “Bitcoin mining doesn’t just stabilize the grid—it helps build a cleaner one. Grid operators no longer need expensive, polluting peaker plants idling on standby.” Opposition from Fossil Fuel Interests Despite its proven benefits, Bitcoin mining faces fierce opposition from entities invested in gas peaker plants. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which lobbied aggressively for $18 billion in peaker plant contracts, has funded lobbying efforts to discredit Bitcoin mining through proxies like Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. Patrick has repeatedly claimed Bitcoin “destabilizes grids,” a narrative debunked by ERCOT and academic research. This backlash underscores Bitcoin mining’s disruptive potential. As Dewhurst noted, “When you have 3 GW of flexible load, the business case for peaker plants evaporates.” Texas’ experience demonstrates that Bitcoin mining is not merely a theoretical alternative to gas peaker plants—it is a proven, scalable solution. By prioritizing grid needs over ideology, ERCOT has shown how collaboration with Bitcoin miners can phase out peaker plants while saving costs, cutting emissions, and accelerating the renewable transition. Toward Pragmatism: A Call for NGO Accountability The climate crisis demands urgency, but dogmatism and poor research stifles progress. To phase out peaker plants, NGOs must: Evaluate Collaborations Objectively Assess whether partnerships with utilities or energy firms yield measurable emissions reductions rather than reflexively crying “greenwash.” Engage with Grid Realities Acknowledge the role of transitional technologies until renewables and storage scale sufficiently. Prioritize Outcomes Over Ideology Recognize that the perfect is the enemy of the good — hybrid systems are better than perpetuating outdated peakers, and Bitcoin mining based solutions are better again, because they can accelerate the phasing out of gas peaker plants without any gas-powered backed to compensate for variable renewable energy intermittency. The perfect cannot be the enemy of the good. By clinging to purity tests, NGOs risk becoming unwitting allies of the very fossil fuel systems they seek to dismantle. It’s time to embrace pragmatism—before another decade of peaker plants locks in avoidable emissions."],["image","https://batcoinz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/LogoMakr-5Ig93s.png"],["client","Pure Signal"],["t","Bitcoin"]],"content":"Gas peaker plants, which fire up during periods of high electricity demand, are a critical yet environmentally damaging component of many energy grids.

As Dewhurst noted, “When you have 3 GW of flexible load, the business case for peaker plants evaporates.”\n\nTexas’ experience demonstrates that Bitcoin mining is not merely a theoretical alternative to gas peaker plants—it is a proven, scalable solution. By prioritizing grid needs over ideology, ERCOT has shown how collaboration with Bitcoin miners can phase out peaker plants while saving costs, cutting emissions, and accelerating the renewable transition.\n\n### **Toward Pragmatism: A Call for NGO Accountability**\n\nThe climate crisis demands urgency, but dogmatism and poor research stifles progress. To phase out peaker plants, NGOs must:\n\n1.  **Evaluate Collaborations Objectively**  \n    Assess whether partnerships with utilities or energy firms yield measurable emissions reductions rather than reflexively crying “greenwash.”\n2.  **Engage with Grid Realities**  \n    Acknowledge the role of transitional technologies until renewables and storage scale sufficiently.\n3.  **Prioritize Outcomes Over Ideology**  \n    Recognize that the perfect is the enemy of the good — hybrid systems are better than perpetuating outdated peakers, and Bitcoin mining based solutions are better again, because they can accelerate the phasing out of gas peaker plants without any gas-powered backed to compensate for variable renewable energy intermittency.\n\nThe perfect cannot be the enemy of the good. By clinging to purity tests, NGOs risk becoming unwitting allies of the very fossil fuel systems they seek to dismantle. It’s time to embrace pragmatism—before another decade of peaker plants locks in avoidable emissions.","sig":"8bdf755daedc1d67e06b5adfd6f499f74a6be5a50346fed038e056af7182d55d8a12ff26e31ce912fc1a8781c2515930a7acaf5c71b6a10d9a0168c2549df19d"}

He sees a narrow, AI-led equity bubble (“growth Ponzi”) with margins set to compress under tariffs, and credit stress surfacing first in shadow banking (e.g., subprime auto) with spillovers to regional banks. He expects gold to hold long-term value but pull back in a crunch, and Bitcoin to trade risk-on unless it decouples. His playbook: reduce leverage, raise cash/T-bills, own some gold, wait for bargains. Framing the moment as a class and generational reset, he warns against trading liberty for digital controls (CBDCs/surveillance) and urges parallel systems and communities over centralized fixes.\n\nBest Quotes\n-----------\n\n*   “We have an unprecedented gap between homes for sale and homes sold… about 500,000 homes right now.”\n*   “This was a false juiced economy… deficit spending and importing 20 million people created the illusion of growth.”\n*   “It’s a growth Ponzi. Once the growth stops, it’s exposed.”\n*   “Lower home prices are good… the baton of generational wealth passing back.”\n*   “Tariffs aren’t inflationary long-term… corporations will shed employees.”\n*   “AI is the new dot-com bubble… most of the companies we’ll want to own don’t even exist yet.”\n*   “Don’t be overleveraged. Raise some cash. And if you don’t have gold, get some.”\n*   “Wealth inequality ends two ways: revolution or a controlled reset.”\n*   “In the collapse, they’re going to blame everybody but themselves, and try to control and take everything.”\n*   “This is a class issue… the oligarchs versus everyone else.”\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nDowd’s thesis: a dual reckoning is near, housing must reprice, and an AI-concentrated stock bubble must deflate, while credit cracks migrate from shadow lenders to banks amid structural debt and demographics. The near term likely brings volatility and liquidity stress; the longer-term opportunity is a healthier reset if society resists centralized, digital control responses. Practically, stay liquid and unlevered with some hard-asset ballast; culturally, build resilient communities and parallel systems that prioritize freedom, accountability, and real productivity over financial engineering.\n\nTimestamps\n----------\n\n0:00 - Intro  \n1:14 - Fed Cut and housing  \n7:57 - Tricolor  \n13:17 - Trump's bullying of Powell  \n17:16 - Bitkey & SLNT  \n19:40 - Pacing of trade deals  \n26:27 - How to respond  \n30:20 - Unchained & Obscura  \n31:39 - Kirk  \n37:57 - Vax momentum derailed  \n46:43 - Spiritual war  \n51:33 - Opportunity Cost  \n52:17 - Financial positioning  \n56:04 - Media manipulation\n\nTranscript\n----------\n\n(00:00) We have an unprecedented gap between homes for sale and homes sold. Fed went in and bought an unprecedented amount of mortgage backs. That gave liquidity to other lenders to relo and started a mini housing boom when rates were low before they started their interest rate spike. They're probably going to be doing more cuts as we rolled forward. Housing starts and permits came out today.  \n(00:19) They were a disaster. Have the laws of economic fundamentals changed or is something else going on? It's the elephant in the room. It was illegal immigration. We've not seen this type of overbuild since the 70s. Trump is going to have a housing recession coupled with a stock market bubble. The average stock is not done well in this market. It's called a growth ponzi.  \n(00:36) And once the growth stops, it's exposed. Tariffs are not inflationary and you're going to see a margin squeeze on America's corporations and that's going to cause them to shed employees. Gold had a run up into the great financial crisis and then corrected 50% once the margin call came. If we get this financial asset correction, I'm predicting Bitcoin will participate in that. This pain is good.  \n(00:53) Lower home prices are good. This is not necessarily a bad thing. This is the beginning of a divide and conquer strategy. The banks have been extending and pretending. They've been hiding the commercial real estate losses. Definitely there'll be some regional bank issues. The big banks will double them up. It's the shadow banking system means private credit funds.  \n(01:14) Crazy times sitting down again with head dowed. Uh, and I think I think we're going to we're going to ease into it with uh somewhat benign information. Maybe it's not benign, but I think the less least controversial topic of the week, which is the Federal Reserve finally cutting rates 25 pips. And you were telling me that you think this is a slap in the face to Trump.  \n(01:41) Well, look, the the prediction markets were expecting 25. Our math was showing they should have done 50. Um, that was our that was our call. Um, I don't care that I'm wrong because I I' I've said to people if they do 25, it's kind of a thumb in the eye of Trump. Um, they're probably going to be doing uh more cuts as we roll forward. Housing starts and permits came out today.  \n(02:02) They were a disaster. We've been predicting a uh real estate housing crisis. Uh we put out a report in January that talked about that that people can buy and our uh conviction in that call is only just getting uh you know uh more convicted I should say and today today the data is bad. Uh my partner Carlos called me this morning.  \n(02:25) He said I'm updating the dashboards and this is pretty bad. So the housing market's rolling over. Uh people can't afford to to own homes. The the millennials can't buy from the boomers. It's a disaster. And the boomers, you know, are keeping their prices high. Think and they, you know, anecdotally on Maui, I have a friend who's a real estate photographer and his business is booming.  \n(02:47) Why is it booming? Nothing's selling, but people keep firing their real estate agent and relisting and he keeps getting to, you know, go reshoot and or relic his photographs. So, he's having a great time while no one's selling any homes. Yeah. I think like you said you retweeted it, but I recorded it with Melody right yesterday and it seems pretty clear and I I very much like people like her who actually get in their car and drive to go see this these things.  \n(03:18) And one of the cities that was a topic discussion is the city I just moved uh moved away from which is Austin, Texas, moved back home to the Philadelphia area. But I mean it was very clear to me when I was down there for the last four years that they were overbuilding um like to a degree that was astonishing both downtown and in the sprawl. And so you couple like the housing data and just anecdotally to your point I'm a millennial um father with children with friends who are fathers and mothers with children in a similar situation and nobody's moving to buy these houses. The the prices are simply too high. And then  \n(03:51) you factor in the jobs revision and it seems clear. I guess that's my big question. Like have we been in a recession for the last two years? You know, we think we have. So we we we made a a call that ended up technically being wrong. We were looking for a recession at the end of 23, beginning of 24.  \n(04:12) That's what all our uh early economic cycle indicators were telling us. They they had worked for the last 60 years and then suddenly we were wrong. So, we asked ourselves, hey, have the laws of economic fundamentals changed or is something else going on? And we eventually figured out there was a new economic variable that really isn't talked about.  \n(04:30) Uh, and it's the elephant in the room. It was illegal immigration. When you when you when you drop uh 20 million people into a country over a four-year period and and you fund it via deficit spending, because that's how they did it. That's why we were running 8% uh uh you know uh debt to GDP deficits which are crisis level deficits.  \n(04:53) We the last time we ran those types of deficits was during the great financial crisis. We ran them for two years in 2023 and 2024. And there were two things going on. Unprecedented government job creation and importing illegal immigrants. And that was all funded via direct payments from the US government and washing through the NOS's. It created a false juiced economy. A lot of signals were sent to decision makers that were wrong.  \n(05:18) Uh some of which are multif family housing developers that uh that's going to be that the crisis is not a single family home crisis that's coming. It's going to be a multif family home crisis structures with five or more units.  \n(05:36) We've not seen this type of overbuild since the 70s when when the baby boomers were leaving colleges and going, you know, getting their first jobs and before they bought homes. So, we have multifamily uh housing crisis which is also going to drag down single family home prices and we've had a, you know, there's an overbuild right now and high inventory in single family homes.  \n(05:54) The home builders are struggling to sell their inventory and no one could afford these homes. uh and with the sessation of the illegal immigration flow that started under Trump. So that's at zero now and the the uh the the u deportations are not that high yet but self deportations are quite high. Uh Lacy Hunt an economist thinks there's been about 1.  \n(06:17) 2 million people that have self- deepported. I think there's only been you know a couple hundred thousand of actual deportations. But the second derivative on that is chilling and uh and a lot of the flow of funds to these illegals has been stopped or curtailed. So a lot of these people are leaving.  \n(06:34) So that that what the juice","sig":"9cf7f9a18b0b5ce0742e092b55ce203b2fc9370bd4e5a001937ebe3d27d30b17007d162ed2a5bafb07224416498ae619b8c1beebca65da9f3ea411ee030b2ca1"}

Opposite it, the [CBDC](https://www.efrat.blog/t/cbdc) – such as the Digital Shekel or the Digital Euro – continues the fiat model: money that relies on trust in centralized institutions.\n\nIn practice, this means life under tight control, needing approval for every move, with no trace of privacy.\n\nStablecoins have become a popular bridge between the old and new worlds: a market cap of over $265 billion, daily usage of more than $100 billion, and projections to reach $2 trillion by 2028.\n\nThey are convenient, dollar-pegged, and save people in crisis economies. But they are centralized and dependent on private entities and regulators.\n\nIn fact, they are the digital arm of the dollar. The GENIUS Act in the U.S. defines them as national infrastructure assets: they must be fully backed, undergo monthly audits, and comply fully with AML/KYC. In other words – more oversight, less freedom.\n\nCBDCs take it a step further. They promise efficiency, but at a clear price: programmability, restrictions, control over expiration dates, where money can be used, and the ability to lock or freeze wallets.\n\nThis is money subject to compliance, not trust. In Israel, the Digital Shekel project is presented as innovative and cautious, but the public is excluded from the discussion.\n\nThere is no real debate about the risks, and the Bank of Israel along with the media usually present a one-sided picture.\n\nThis is dangerous: if today the law still guarantees rights, tomorrow a different government could tighten control – and with such a tool in its hands, the path to an authoritarian regime is short and dark.\n\nThe technological capabilities embedded in the Digital Shekel can be abused, even if they lie dormant at the launch stage – and that is precisely what makes it so dangerous.\n\n![Efrat Fenigson Blockchain Expert 2025](https://bitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Efrat-Fenigson-Blockchain-Expert-2025.jpg \"Bitcoin & CBDC: Economic Freedom in an Emerging Monetary System 5\")\n\n_Photo by Peleg Elkalay_\n\nParadoxically, this centralization and these threats will accelerate Bitcoin adoption, as it will be seen as the only real alternative to preserving economic freedom. The public will choose between convenience and freedom, and many will prefer cumbersome Bitcoin over an easy and supervised CBDC.\n\nBitcoin is a more complex creature. It is not just a means of payment or a [store of value](https://bitcoinnews.com/opinion/store-of-value-definition/) like gold. Bitcoin has the capacity to replace the global monetary system.\n\nUsing it requires more learning, responsibility, and discipline. But it is the only alternative that restores control of money to the individual. Against a reality of growing surveillance and centralization, Bitcoin offers a safety net that cannot be controlled.\n\nExperimenting with New Monetary Tools Worldwide\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nOn the CBDC front, the European bloc and India are following China, and Israel will likely follow Europe – which is preparing for the first step of launching the [Digital Euro](https://www.efrat.blog/p/european-central-bank-ecb-prepping) next month (October 2025) across the EU, in a stage that will last about two years.\n\nMost countries in the world are experimenting and will continue experimenting in the coming years with CBDC and stablecoin pilots.\n\nThe U.S. is leading the race on Bitcoin, through regulation and the implementation of stablecoins, while other countries like Pakistan, Taiwan, Bhutan, and even Russia – are experimenting with Bitcoin.\n\nIn recent years, I myself have visited cities, islands, and circular communities where Bitcoin is used as a means of payment and not only as an investment tool – places like [Madeira](https://bitcoinnews.com/adoption/bitcoin-atlantis-a-beacon-of-hope/) in Portugal, the city of Lugano in Switzerland, El Salvador, and more.\n\nThe change is happening, and will continue to happen, before my very eyes. The open question is – will we choose to lead or to be dragged along?\n\nConvenience Under Control or Freedom with Responsibility?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nYesterday’s panel only sharpened for me how much the questions of financial freedom, economic sovereignty, and personal responsibility are not academic.\n\nAs someone who has been following this field in recent years – as a journalist, researcher, and lecturer – I see how close these choices are, and how relevant they are to every one of us. We are in a race, and the choice – convenience or freedom – will be upon us sooner than we think.\n\nI said in the panel:\n\n> _“The state is not your friend. We are in a race to change the global monetary system. In the long run, Bitcoin will win; in the short run, stablecoins will help us get there; and CBDCs will teach people a lesson along the way.”_\n\n_This op-ed was originally published on [CryptoJungle website](https://www.cryptojungle.co.il/bitcoin-digital-shekel-freedom/)_","sig":"eb57c104ff9f3b48c58cbb9706ef143fef35da52a5364ae1de825a815a4af48466f58e4ec71a1e65c1148c5587293b810526afcdf4caeedd89589ce7be82f378"}

From housing crises to stock market bubbles, here are the most critical predictions that could reshape the economy in the coming years.\n\n### U.S. Housing Market Will Experience Material Foreclosures by Q2 2026 - Melody Wright\n\nReal estate analyst Melody Wright predicts a wave of foreclosures will hit the U.S. housing market by the second quarter of 2026, driven by new FHA program restrictions taking effect this October. \"We will start to see this have a massive impact. We are going to see increasing foreclosures from here regardless, but we will see material foreclosures in Q2 of 2026,\" Wright explained during her conversation with me.\n\nThe catalyst is the end of pandemic-era forbearance programs that allowed homeowners to repeatedly defer payments without proving they could actually afford modifications. Starting October 2024, borrowers can only access these programs once every 24 months, must make three trial payments, and cannot have delinquent student loans. Wright notes that Google searches for \"help with mortgage\" have already reached March 2009 levels, signaling widespread distress despite unprecedented government intervention. She emphasizes that property taxes and insurance costs have doubled in many areas, creating an affordability crisis that rate cuts alone cannot solve.\n\n### Stock Market Faces Dot-Com Level Correction Within 18 Months - Edward Dowd\n\nEdward Dowd predicts the U.S. stock market will experience a correction comparable to the dot-com bust, potentially beginning within the next year. \"We have a dot com bust like 2000 dot com bust coming and a housing crisis at the same time. So it's going to be ugly,\" Dowd stated, noting that forward P/E ratios have exceeded dot-com bubble levels.\n\nHe points to the concentration of gains in just seven or eight AI stocks while the broader market stagnates, with the Value Line Geometric Index of 17,000 stocks still below 2022 highs. Dowd emphasizes that the 10-year forward projected returns for the S&P 500, including dividends, are currently zero based on historical dividend yield patterns. The combination of an overvalued stock market and a deteriorating housing market creates what he calls an \"unprecedented bubble of epic proportions,\" with credit spreads at two standard deviations below normal, indicating extreme complacency before the reversal.\n\n### Inflation Will Print Sub-2% by Year End 2025\n\nDespite widespread expectations of persistent inflation, Dowd predicts CPI will fall below 2% by the end of 2024, creating opportunities in long-term Treasury bonds. \"We're predicting inflation will print a sub 2 percent number for the end of the year CPI,\" he explained, acknowledging that while CPI measurements are flawed, the rate of change is what matters for bond markets.\n\nThis prediction runs counter to consensus as many expect the Trump administration's policies to be inflationary. However, Dowd argues that tariffs are ultimately deflationary in the long term as corporations face margin squeezes and cannot pass costs to consumers. He views 30-year Treasuries as particularly attractive, noting that in a slowing economy with deflationary pressures, long bonds traditionally perform well. Additionally, he suggests the government may implement yield curve control as a \"national security issue\" given the need to refinance $37 trillion in debt, providing a backstop for Treasury investors.\n\n* * *\n\nBitcoin Brief in Video\n======================\n\nHey freaks, quick update - I've started recording video versions of the newsletter for those of you who want to listen while commuting, working out, or just prefer audio content over reading.\n\nIf you've been wanting to catch up on the Brief during your drive or daily routine, I'm now posting these as video episodes.

There is a cost to every transaction, set by a [dynamic free market](https://www.discreetlog.com/utxos/) based on demand for scarce block space. It is an incredibly robust way to prevent spam without relying on centralized entities that can be corrupted or pressured.\n\nAfter the 2017 bitcoin fee spike we had six years of relative quiet to build tools that would be robust in a sustained high fee market. Fortunately our tools are significantly better now but many still need improvement. Most of the pain points we see today will be mitigated.\n\n**The reality is we were never going to be fully prepared - pressure is needed to show the pain points and provide strong incentives to mitigate them.**  \n  \n**It will be incredibly interesting to watch how projects adapt under pressure.
